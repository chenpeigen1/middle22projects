从猫眼里都能看到你的影子

我不能出门
I can't go outside

32

00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,770
可你都出门偷邻居报纸了

34
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,070
我没偷啊

35
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,570
我留了五美金
I left $5.

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,970
标价才五十美分啊

00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,810
你的邻居同意把报纸卖给你了吗
Did your neighbor consent to sell you her paper?

38
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,800
我
I...

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,550
她  这
She -- i-isn't --

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,720
警官  让我们
L-- um, officer, let's -- let's --

41
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,890
来谈谈一个叫"合理根据"的东西
Let's talk about something called "Probable cause."

42
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,890
{\an8}警察有权逮捕的根据

43
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,090
你们肯定知道  在新墨西哥州
As I'm sure you know, in the state of New Mexico,

44
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,270
有一个两部分的测试
there is a two-part test

45
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,230
来决定警官是否有
to determine whether police officers

46
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,340
客观上合理的依据...
have an objectively reasonable basis...

47
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,020
在对亚利桑那州的诉讼中
...the situation a-as missing,

48
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,260
该情况是缺失的
versus Arizona,

49
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,930
正如我指出的  造成一个后果...
as I pointed out creates an event...

50
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,120
汤米  过来看看
Hey, Tommy. Come around here, would you?

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,930
这就是为什么第十巡回上诉法庭
A-and that's why the 10th circuit court of appeals

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,690
判了强制令...
ruled that a coercive order...

53
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,440
看看这个
Check this out.

54
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,030
要求一个人离开自己家无异于抓捕
...requiring an individual leave his house is seizure...

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,950
因此
...and, therefore,

56

{\an8}禁止无理搜查和扣押

57
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,330

都是便携炉用的燃料
Whole lot of camp-stove fuel.

他简直就像个神经病
Guy sure as shit sounds like a tweaker.

60
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,590
你看到他的电路盒了吗
You see what he did to the breaker box?

61
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,710
他出来  还是我们进去
Is he coming out, or are we going in?

62
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,140
你有十秒钟的时间开门
You got 10 seconds to open this door,

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,920
不然我们会破门而入  你听到了吗
or it's coming down. You hear me?

64
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,850
这是最后的警告
Final warning!

65
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,260
我让你们进来
Okay, I'll-I'll let you in,

66
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,600
但你们得把所有的电子设备都留在外面
but you have to leave your electronic devices outside.

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,240
手机  对讲机
No phones, no walkie-talkies,

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,300
手电筒
no flashlights--

69
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,430
电击枪更不能带进来
definitely, definitely no tasers.

70
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,720
这个最为关键  行吗
I can't emphasize that enough. Deal?

71
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,460
我会把报纸还回去的
Or, look, look. I'll give the paper back.

80
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,390
吉米  我在电视上看到你了

81
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,760

我发现了两个闪光点
And I had me a pair of insights.

83
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,780
第一个闪光点
Insight the first--

你不怕舍身救人
you ain't afraid to put yourself out there.

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,860
第二个闪光点
And insight the second,

86
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,210
你相信真正的美国精神
you believe in the real America--

87
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,480
自由自在  自给自足
freedom, self-sufficiency.

88
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,140
我相信  我真的相信
I do. I-I really do.

89
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,330
当我看到像你这样的人
When I see a man like you

90
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,970
开着那辆烂车
driving that foreign shitbox of a car...

91
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,930
那辆车其实是

92
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,070
说明这年头  好人没有好报

真是荒谬至极
It's a damned travesty. That's what it is.

94
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,500
也许是这样  里基
Well, that may be, Ricky,

95
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,070
但是
but...

96
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,900
我不认为自己是个受害者
I refuse to consider myself a victim.

97

历史再一次重演了
You know, we are once again at a point in our history

98
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,990
政府那苍蝇拍一样的大手
where the fly-swatting hand of government

99
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,240
正在扼杀企业家的自由灵魂
is crushing the spirit of entrepreneurship --

100
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,310
税收  职业安全与健康管理局的要求
Taxes, OSHA requirements,

101
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,410
国新社用肥大的鼻子嗅着每一个雇员的动作
the I.N.S. poking their big, fat nose into every mother-loving hire.

102
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,400
这是赤裸裸的压迫
It's damned oppressive.

103
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,770
很不幸
It's tragic.

104
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,760
这是非美国式的
It's un-American.

105
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,800
吉米  我认为你就是我所需要的律师
Jim, I think you are just the lawyer I need,

106
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,510
因为我的案子很大  是个大案子
'cause I got me a case -- major -- I say, a major case.

107
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,810
你准备好腾出时间了吗
Are you ready to clear your calendar?

108
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,070
里基  我洗耳恭听
Ricky, I'm all ears.

109
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,240
我要脱离美利坚合众国
I want to secede from the United States.

110
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,650
如今我在这里有4.4平方公里的房产
Now, I got 1,100 acres of property here,

111
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,520
用太阳能和井水可以自给自足
self-sustaining with solar power and wells,

112
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,880
不受垄断条令约束的主权国
a sovereign state immune to the business-killing regulations

113
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,340
虽在美国地理范围内却不受管制
of the country in which it geographically lies.

114
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,770
我们要成为美国的梵蒂冈城
We are going to be America's Vatican City.

115
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,570
里基
Ricky...

116
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,490
我跟你干
I'm your man.

117
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,360
好啊  我们开始吧
Yeah, let's do this.

118
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,650
让我们做给他们看
Let's show 'em all.

119
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,220
是的  我们就要这样做
Yes! We are doing this!

120
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,910
可是这条路不会一帆风顺的
Now, it's not gonna be easy, sir.

121
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,580
政府会跟我们展开恶战
I mean, the government is gonna fight us tooth and nail.

122
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,050
最后我们可能会上最高法院
We could end up in the Supreme Court --

123
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,450
这可能要花费数千工时
I'm talking thousands of man-hours --

124
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,700
经过数年的努力
I mean, years of effort.

125
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,840
你准备好了吗
Are you ready for that?

126
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,740
我吗
Me?

127
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,870
让他们放马过来吧
I say bring 'em on.

128
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,970
我们开诚布公地说吧
Let's talk turkey.

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,910
你的收费标准是多少
What's your rate?

130
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,360
每小时四百五十元
$450 an hour.

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,150
不按小时算
The hell with hourly.

132
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,460
直接付定金
I want you on retainer.

133
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:24,860
一百万怎么样
How about $1 million even --

134
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,170
预付五十万  搞定后再付另一半
$500,000 up front and $500,000 when we're done?

135
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,100
一百万
A million?

136
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,180
听起来  很公平
That seems...fair.

137
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
你愿意收现金吗
Would you like that in cash?

138
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,010
免税而且有桑迪亚共和国的
Tax-free and backed by the full faith and credit

139
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,940
十足信用作为担保
of the sovereign Sandia Republic.

140
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,860
这是...
It's, uh...

141
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,630
小子  你占尽了先机啊
Son...you are getting in on the ground floor.

142
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,450

谢谢你
Well, thank you.

150
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,790
天呐  爬那个广告板是什么感觉
God, what was it like climbing that billboard?

151
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,380
一定很吓人吧
Must have been pretty scary, huh?

152
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,540
那个人需要帮助  仅此而已
Guy needed help -- that's all.

153
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,360
其实我做的事  别人也都能做
You know, if I could do it, anybody could.

154
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,290
我很佩服你
Well, my hat is off to you.

155
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,760
就是这里了
So, here we are.

156
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,820
专利法是不是你...
And patent law is something you --

157
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,910
是的  实际上我接过很多专利案件
Oh, yeah. In fact, I-I do so many patent cases,

158
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,680
我以后专接专利案件得了
I should probably just go ahead and specialize already.

159
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,480
这是什么
So, what do we got?

160
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,830
-我有个不情之请  -请说
- I feel silly asking this. - Yeah.

161
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,450
在我向你展示我的发明之前
But before I show you my invention,

162
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,890
你介不介意签署一份保密协议
would you mind signing a non-disclosure agreement?

163
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,490
当然可以  没问题
You got it. No problem.

164
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,570
这是我毕生的心血
It's my idea of a lifetime.

165
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,410
万一费雪或者孩之宝得知了这个想法...
If Fisher-Price or Playskool ever got their hands on this...

166
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,410
{\an8}美国玩具商

167
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,610
无需担心
No worries.

168
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,860
准备好了吗
You ready?

169
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,770
我以前好像看过这样的东西
I may have seen one of these before.

170
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,170
和这个不一样
Not like this.

171
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,210
我在这上面加了个小装置
This one has this little unit I've added.

172
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,760
这才是我的发明
This is my invention.

173
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,460
-你有孩子吗  -没有
- Do you have children? - No.

174
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,710
我和我妻子有两个男孩  一个四岁一个六岁
My wife and I have two boys -- 4 and 6.

175
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,750
说真的  教他们学会上厕所
And let me tell you -- toilet-training them?

176
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,120
真是场噩梦  两个都是
Nightmare, both times.

177
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,250
他们不习惯用坐便器
They just didn't want to use the commode.

178
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,400
所以我在传感器上连了一个语音芯片
So I wired a motion sensor to a voice chip,

179
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,830
没必要说得那么专业
and, well, no sense getting all technical,

180
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,670
关键就是正强化
but it's all about positive reinforcement.

181
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,670
{\an8}通过鼓励使一行为形成

182
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,160
这就是"如厕好伙伴托尼"
Meet Tony the toilet buddy.

183
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,320
当你坐下去准备上厕所
And when you sit down to do your business,

184
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,160
它是这样工作的
this is how he works.

185
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,790
对  就是这样
Oh, yeah, that's the way!

186
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,820
天呐  好大
Gosh, you're big!

187
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,280
你真大
You're so big!

188
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,790
天呐  你真棒
My goodness! Look at you!

189
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,640
快把我塞满  钱德勒
Fill me up, Chandler!

190
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,050
快放进来
Put it in me!

191
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,260
钱德勒是我的小儿子  他很喜欢
Chandler's my youngest -- loves it.

192
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,440
快给我  钱德勒  我想要
Give it to me, Chandler! I want it all!

193
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,650
后面还有呢
Anyway, it goes on from there.

194
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,820
不过大致就这样
You get the picture.

195
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,440
没错  我...
Yeah, I, uh...

196
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,740
是的
Yeah.

197
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,510
那么你觉得怎么样
So, what do you think?

198
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,260
这是不是太挑逗了
It's a little sexual, maybe?

199
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,460
挑逗  你是什么意思...
Sexual? What -- what does that...

200
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,700
带有某种暗示  可能
Suggestive, maybe --

201
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,410
可能这种说法比较合适
Maybe that's a better word.

202
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,610
听着  我并没有
Look, I'm not --

203
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,510
我不是说这个发明不会让你发财
I'm not saying this thing won't make you rich.

204
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,420
有些环太平洋国家的富人
I mean, some of your wealthier Pacific rim nations --

205
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,850
那帮变态疯子  他们会爱死这个的
They'll love this -- the crazy bastards.

206
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,730
这项发明是面向孩子的  孩子  明白吗
I created this for children -- children, understand?

207
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,050
伟哥起初还是用来治疗高血压的呢
Viagra was originally invented to treat hypertension.

208
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,160
结果呢
Look how that turned out.

209
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,120
你真是叫人作呕
You're completely disgusting, you know that?!

210
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,350
伙计  你才是发明性爱马桶的人
Hey, buddy, you're the one with the sex toilet.

211
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,810
马上滚出我家
Get off my property!

212
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,670
对了
Hey, you know what?

213
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,020
我真心希望你能大赚一笔
I hope you do make a fortune,

214
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,170
然后用这笔钱给钱德勒做心理治疗吧
'cause Chandler's gonna need it to help pay for his therapy!

215
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:47,150
{\an8}邻里联合对抗犯罪

216
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,750
我找到了阿尔卑斯牧童
I found the Alpine Shepherd boy!

217
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,090
不  你就坐那儿
No, no. You just stay put.

218
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,620
我这就过去
I'll be right over.

219
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,710
我们说到哪儿了
Now, where were we?

220
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,210
再来点茶吧
Oh, would you like some more tea?

221
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,830
不  谢谢  不用了
No! No, thank you. I'm -- I'm fine.

222
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,810
那么牧羊少年赫梅尔
Now, the shepherd boy Hummel --

223
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,920
是要留给你的侄子克拉伦斯吗
That's gonna go to your nephew Clarence?

224
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,040
-只要他能念完大学  -好的
- As long as he finishes college. - Okay.

225
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,890
如果他辍学  那就留给我的侄女雷琳
If he drops out, it goes to my niece Raylene.

226
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,800
但雷琳就得不到那个姑娘...
But then, Raylene doesn't get the girl --

227
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,260
那个养鹅姑娘
The girl with the geese.

228
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,640
那就留给你的表亲海伦
Yeah. No, then that would go to your cousin Helen...

229
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,080
条件是她不和弗雷德里克复婚对吗
...so long as she never remarries Frederick?

230
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,620
-没错  -好的
- Exactly. - Yeah.

231
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,300
还有这对黄发双胞胎瓷人
And no matter what, I want the towheaded twins

232
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,590
我无论如何要留给劳伦斯教士的孙子
to go to Reverend Lawrence's grandson.

233
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,680
你是说黑尼斯教士吗
Um, don't you mean Reverend Hanes?

234
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,790
因为要留给劳伦斯教士孙子的
'Cause Reverend Lawrence's grandson is going to get

235
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:02,140
是这个吹笛天使  他是唱诗班的
the, uh, Lute-playing angel, 'cause he was in the choir.

236
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,330
脑子转得真快  麦吉尔先生
Very sharp, Mr. McGill.

237
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,590
我还以为律师都是傻瓜呢
And here I thought all lawyers were idiots.

238
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,320
一半是傻瓜
No, only half of us are idiots.

239
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,870
剩下的一半都是骗子
The other half are crooks.

240
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,710
你真风趣
Aren't you a spicy one?

241
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,210
要是我再年轻四十岁
If I were 40 years younger,

242
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,490
我肯定会要你请我喝一杯果汁朗姆酒
I'd have you buy me a Pina colada.

243
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,200
如果你让我起草一份放弃急救同意书
Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR,

244
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,280
我就带上搅拌机和菠萝
I'll bring a blender and some pineapple.

245
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
当我在电视上看到
I knew I'd like you

246
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,960
你是如何英勇救人的时候我就喜欢上你了
when I saw how you saved that poor man on the television.

247
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,720
世风日下  勇气已经很少见了
Moxie is in such short supply these days.

248
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,220
没错
Yeah.

249
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,130
我也很以自己的勇气为荣
Well, I pride myself on my moxie.

250
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,850
虽然我不想这样
Now, I hate to do this,

251
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,130
但我必须得说一下我的报酬问题
but I do need to bring up my payment.

252
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,840
很抱歉
Um and I'm sorry,

253
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,740
{\an8}绿色盾牌邮票  由S&H公司发售
集齐一套可兑换公司产品

254
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,740
我不接受绿色盾牌邮票作为支付方式
but I can't accept S&H green stamps.

255
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,340
我一共要收取您一百四十块
Now, uh, my fee is $140.

256
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,280
一百四
$140?

257
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,960
您可以今天先给我七十块
I'll gladly accept $70 today.

258
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,060
等我把所有文件都准备好以后
And $70 when I come back

259
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,260
再把剩下的七十块给我
with the completed documents, if...

260
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,060
二十  四十  六十
$20, $40, $60...

261
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,670
八十  一百
$80, $100...

262
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,520
一百二  一百四
And $20, $40.

263
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,540
好的
Uh. Okay.

264
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,560
麦吉尔先生  我们能继续了吗
Shall we continue, Mr. McGill?

265
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,980
当然了  我们继续  施特劳斯太太
Yes. Yes, we shall, Mrs. Strauss.

266
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,270
要涂在指甲上  别蹭到皮上
Put it on the nail, not the skin.

267
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,190
你的脚趾这么小  我也没办法
I can't help it if your toes are too small.

268
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,950
如果都长得一样大
They should all be the same size --

269
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,800
都像大脚趾一样
the size of the big toe.

270
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,380
那我就好办了
That one I can do.

271
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,760
是啊  那样看起来才迷人
Yeah, that would be attractive.

272
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,180
你今天怎么样
So... how's it go again?

273
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,080
钱德勒  你好大噢
Oh, you're huge, Chandler!

274
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,530
你真是个大家伙
You're a big, big boy!

275
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,140
还这么长
Oh, where does it end?!

276
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,600
别停啊  钱德勒
Oh, don't stop, Chandler!

277
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,230
别停
Don't stop!

278
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,200
哎呦  来了来了
Oh, here it comes!

279
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,660
那是什么啊
Oh, what is that?

280
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,860
-那是一粒玉米吗  -你别说了
- Is that a piece of corn? - No, don't.

281
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,270
你是不是吃玉米了  钱德勒
Did you eat corn, Chandler?

282
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,140
-不会是玉米吧  钱德勒  -真恶心
- Is that a niblet I see, Chandler? - That's disgusting.

283
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,920
-求你别讲了  -你受不了了吗
- No, don't. - Too much?

284
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,740
就是这么有趣
Hey, good times.

285
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,210
你的生活就是再糟糕
Oh. Even your lousy days

286
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,880
也比我那些好日子有趣
are more interesting than my good ones.

287
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,530
是吗  那我们可得想办法改变一下了
Yeah, well, we should definitely do something about that.

288
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,790
说真的  你将来可千万别这样过活
Seriously, don't ever try to make a living at this.

289
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,450
好好干你的律师吧
Stick with the law.

290
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,890
是啊  因为只有在法律这一行里
Yeah, because I'm really...

291
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,750
我才能做出点颠覆世界的事
lighting the world on fire in that department.

292
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,710
你今天办理了两份遗嘱吗
Did two wills today?

293
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,770
没错  还帮人起草了一份生前信托
Two wills, and I started a living trust.

294
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,080
老头老太太可待见我了
Whoopee! Old people love me.

295
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,090
也许你可以考虑去做老年法律师
Maybe you got a future in Elder law.

296
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,930
你觉得我能行吗
You think I could handle all that glamour?

297
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,900
我可是认真的
No, I'm serious.

298
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,420
我自己也想做
I-I've thought about getting into Elder law myself.

299
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,370
我奶奶快不行的时候  我就在一旁看着
I watched my grandmother at the end.

300
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,580
简直
It's...

301
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,450
简直太可怕  不得不和保险公司周旋
It's awful what people have to deal with -- insurance companies.

302
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,700
我那些混蛋堂兄弟偷了她的存款和止痛药
My scumbag cousins stealing her savings and her pain meds.

303
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,370
人老了很悲惨
Getting old sucks.

304
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,920
老年人需要有人支持
Seniors need someone on their side.

305
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,230
是霍华德
It's Howard.

306
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,060
他到底要干嘛
What the hell does he want?

307
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,600
霍华德
Hi, Howard.

308
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,780
没有  我是说我还没...
Uh, no. I mean, I haven't, uh...

309
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,050
天哪  什么时候
Oh, my god. When?

310
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,720
好的
Yeah, okay.

311
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,180
我看我能不能找到吉米
I'll see if I can, um, track Jimmy down.

312
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,370
我会打给你的  没问题
I'll call you back. S-sure.

313
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,570
你哥出事了
It's Chuck.

314
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,470
查克
Chuck.

315
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,900
查克  能听到我说话吗
Chuck, you with me?

316
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,890
查克  是我啊
Chuck, hey, buddy. It's me.

317
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,450
你能说话吗
Hey, can you talk to me?

318
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,040
老天啊  真是帮混蛋
Jesus Christ. These sons of bitches.

319
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,690
先生  快停下
Hey, hey. Sir, you can't do that.

320
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,340
-所有设备都得开着  -不行  不能有电
- All of this needs to stay on. - No, no. No electricity.

321
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,110
你明白吗
You understand?

322
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,560
不行  设备必须得开着  我叫保安了
No, it needs to be on. I'm getting security.

323
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,770
你别去  等等
No, uh, wait, wait.

324
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,230
你等等  别去  等等啊
Wait, wait. Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

325
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,910
那盏怎么没关
Huh? Why isn't that one going out?

326
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,850
-吉米  吉米  -去死吧
- Jimmy. Jimmy. - Damn it.

327
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,530
吉米  等下  吉米  冷静
I just -- Jimmy, wait a second. Jimmy. Think.

328
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,540
-你想干嘛  -先生  先生
- What's the plan here? - Sir? Sir?

329
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,710
先生  请你下来
Sir, I need you to get down from there.

330
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,710
你们这是酷刑室吗
What the hell kind of torture chamber you running here?

331
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,300
他对电流过敏  知道吗
He -- he's allergic to electricity, all right?

332
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,420
你听到医生说的了  快下来
You heard the doc. Get down now.

333
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,920
不  这些灯还有机器
No, all these lights and machines --

334
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,140
你还不如直接把他扔进微波炉里
you might as well throw him into a microwave.

335
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,830
-快下来  -别碰我
- Come on down now. - No, don't touch me!

336
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,290
他是病人的弟弟  请听他说
He is this patient's brother. Please, listen to him.

337
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,090
-我们走  -等下
- Hey, let's go. - Hey. Wait.

338
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,400
等一下  埃德温
Hold on a second, Edwin.

339
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,030
先生  你平静下来了吗
Sir, are you ready to calm down now?

340
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,040
是的  他叫吉米  并且他会平静下来的
Yes. His name is Jimmy, and, yes, he is gonna calm down.

341
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,440
我需要你亲口说  吉米
I need you to say the words, Jimmy.

342
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,460
我需要听你说
I need to hear it from you.

343
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,560
我很平静  好吗  平静
I'm calm, okay? I'm calm.

344
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,310
埃德温  你到走廊去等好吗
Edwin, why don't you go wait in the hallway?

345
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,830
需要的话我会叫你
I'll call if we need you.

346
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,920
好了  跟我说说电流的事儿
Okay, so, tell me about the electricity.

347
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,500
听着  我知道这听起来很荒谬  但是真的
Yeah, look, I know how it sounds, but it's real.

348
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,060
该死
Oh, shit.

349
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,450
我的手机和其它有电池的东西
My phone and stuff -- anything with a battery in it --

350
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,940
都不能靠近他
he can't have it near him.

351
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,180
等一下
Hang on.

352
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,140
-这是我的手机  -好了  这就行了
- Here's my phone. - Okay, that's it.

353
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,120
谢谢
Thanks.

354
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,060
好了  到底发生什么了
Okay, what the hell happened to him?

355
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,680
他为什么在这里
Why is he here?

356
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,110
很明显  查尔斯偷了邻居报纸
Apparently, it started when Charles stole his neighbor's newspaper.

357
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,290
什么  他从来不离开房子
What? He -- he never leaves the house.

358
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,880
我不知道所有的细节
I don't -- I don't have all the details,

359
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,900
但警察找到他时他非常激动
but the police found him in a very agitated state.

360
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,640
具有很强的攻击性并且语无伦次
He was confrontational and incoherent.

361
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,490
你怎么不给我打电话
How come you didn't call me?

362
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,040
我为什么要从我哥哥的
Uh, why did I have to hear about this

363
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,890
混蛋律师合伙人那里听到这些
through my brother's prick of a law partner?

364
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,650
我们找到的唯一联系方式
The only contact information we could find

365
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,120
是一张名片
was a business card.

366
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,820
吉米  我的意见是  查尔斯需要住院
Jimmy, in my opinion, Charles should be committed

367
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,740
进行三十天的精神科观察
for 30 days of psychiatric observation.

368
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:26,870
作为家庭成员
As a family member,

369
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,240
你可以为他提交评估申请
you can submit a petition for him to be evaluated.

370
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,550
拉斯克鲁塞斯有家非常好的机构
There's an excellent facility in Las Cruces.

371
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,990
他明天就可以去
He can be there tomorrow.

372
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,360
我还是不去了
I'd rather not.

373
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,490
伙计  我在这儿呢
Hey, buddy. Hey, I'm right here.

374
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,600
查克
Oh, hey, Chuck.

375
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,010
抱歉
Excuse me.

376
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,060
麦吉尔先生  我是克鲁兹医生
Mr. McGill, My name is Dr. Cruz.

377
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,900
你知道你为什么在医院吗
Do you know why you're in the hospital?

378
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,260
警察强行进入  没有搜查证  没有理由
The police kicked in my door -- no warrant, no cause.

379
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,780
我没有语无伦次
I wasn't incoherent.

380
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,530
只是他们不愿听我说
They just weren't listening.

381
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,320
他们用了电击枪  吉米
They tasered me, Jimmy.

382
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,210
天哪
Aw, jesus.

383
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,770
金
Kim?

384
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,330
对不起  我回避下
I'm sorry. I can give you privacy.

385
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,030
不不不  没事儿的  留下来
Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. Stay.

386
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,840
霍华德给我打电话
Howard...called me.

387
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,320
他很担心你
He's very concerned about you.

388
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,360
你现在感觉怎么样  麦吉尔先生
How are you feeling now, Mr. McGill?

389
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,750
你有手机或是传呼机吗
Uh, do -- do you have a phone or a -- a pager,

390
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,780
任何装有电池的东西
anything with a battery?

391
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,490
我觉得没有了  我
I don't think so. I...

392
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,040
是啊
Yeah.

393
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,430
一时疏忽  抱歉
Oversight. Sorry about that.

394
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,400
你能跟我说说你现在的情况吗
Can you tell me a little more about your...situation?

395
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,130
这不是什么情况
It's not a situation.

396
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,730
这是一种病症
It's a condition --

397
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,520
电磁过敏症
electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

398
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,900
由于不明原因  我的神经系统
For reasons unknown, my nervous system has become sensitized

399
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,320
对特定频率的电磁辐射变得非常敏感
to certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.

400
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,700
你弟弟说你对电流过敏
Your brother called it an allergy to electricity.

401
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,630
有点过度简化了
Well, it's an oversimplification,

402
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,810
但基本上是正确的
but it's essentially correct.

403
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,020
电子设备会产生相应的电磁场
Electronic devices create their own electromagnetic fields.

404
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,930
我越是接近这种设备  我的症状就越严重
The closer I am to such devices, the worse my symptoms.

405
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,970
什么症状
Which are?

406
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,140
皮肤灼烧感
Burning sensation on my skin,

407
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,610
骨头里又冷得刺骨
a sharp, cold pain in my bones,

408
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,890
肌肉酸痛  心悸
muscle fatigue, heart palpitations,

409
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,860
视线模糊  耳鸣
blurred vision, tinnitus,

410
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,260
眩晕  恶心  呼吸急促
vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath,

411
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,670
-总的来说...  -很难受
- a general -- - It hurts.

412
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,090
没错  很难受
Yes, it hurts.

413
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,120
你什么时候开始出现这种症状的
When did you first experience these symptoms?

414
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,910
肯定是...
Oh, it must have been...

415
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,210
你一年半以前离开公司的
Y-you left the office 18 months ago.

416
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,620
既然这样  那肯定有两年了
Huh. Well, in that case, uh, must have been almost two years.

417
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,710
两年
Two years?

418
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,190
那你也算是忍了很久了
That's a -- that's a long time to live with discomfort.

419
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,020
又来了
Oh, there it is.

420
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,140
你觉得我疯了
You think I'm crazy.

421
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,130
我没这么说
I never said that.

422
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,830
你是没说  因为你很有礼貌
No, you didn't, because you're very polite,

423
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,280
但你是这么想的
but you think it.

424
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,070
不然你不会跟我提什么送精神病院
Otherwise, you wouldn't be talking about commitment.

425
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,760
你不喜欢谈论那个吗
You find that idea distressing.

426
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,140
谁他妈会喜欢
Who the hell wouldn't?

427
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,660
我觉得这样对待一个
I -- I find it inappropriate

428
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,710
肉体上遭受折磨的人实在是太不人道了
for a person suffering from a physical condition.

429
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,980
只要跟我多待段时间
Anyone who's spent more than a few minutes with me

430
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,380
就会知道这不是我的幻觉
knows that this isn't some kind of delusion.

431
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,740
你同意吗  金
Wouldn't you agree, Kim?

432
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,060
她当然同意
Of course she does.

433
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,680
我又不是医生
Well, I'm not a doctor.

434
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,100
你都认识我快十年了
You've known me for the better part of a decade.

435
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,260
你见过我表现出任何征兆
Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign --

436
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,930
任何精神疾病的征兆吗
any sign whatsoever of mental illness?

437
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,910
看到没
See?

438
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,220
如果我觉得你能治好我
I-if I thought for one second you could cure me,

439
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,590
相信我  我绝对会把握这个机会
believe me, I'd jump at the chance.

440
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,850
但恕我冒犯
But with all due respect,

441
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,830
找精神病医生是行不通的
psychiatry doesn't have the answers.

442
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,230
我愿意一试
I'd very much like to try.

443
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,100
第43章第一条第十一点  E13部分
Section 43-1-11, part E13.

444
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,030
"入院申请要与病人的
"The proposed commitment is consistent with

445
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,550
"实际治疗需求相吻合
"the treatment needs of the client

446
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,480
并且要避免采取极端手段"
and with the least drastic means principle."

447
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,570
你们觉得让我忍受这种痛苦一个月
Do you think subjecting me to this kind of pain for a month

448
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,010
不算是极端手段吗
is the least drastic means?

449
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,590
还不如把他扔到削木机里一个月
He might as well spend a month in a wood chipper.

450
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,080
我知道你很难受  真的
I understand your frustration. I do.

451
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,920
你显然头脑非常清楚
You're obviously a highly intelligent man

452
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,680
只是身体状况不如人意
in difficult circumstances.

453
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,970
我能问你个问题吗  只是我个人好奇
May I ask you a question, just for my own interest?

454
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,150
你怎么解决你的一些日常需要呢
How do you meet the needs of daily life?

455
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,030
要照明怎么办呢
What do you do for light, or...

456
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,760
或者怎么准备食物
how do you prepare food?

457
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,050
我用无铅汽油灯
I use white-gas lanterns.

458
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,030
煮饭的话我有个便携炉
For cooking, I have a camp stove.

459
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,420
我还有个冷却器  要不停往里面加冰块
I have a large cooler I keep filled with ice.

460
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,460
虽然不好用  但还凑合
It's not ideal, but I make do.

461
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,410
我知道了
I see.

462
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,200
谢谢
Well, thank you.

463
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,350
如果你不介意的话
Would you mind if I took a moment

464
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,850
我能和你弟弟谈谈吗
to speak with your brother?

465
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,680
谈完后确认下你的钱包还在自己身上
Oh, uh, make sure you still have your wallet when you're done.

466
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,550
真好笑
Funny guy.

467
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,410
吉米
Jimmy.

468
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,420
我想回家
I want to go home.

469
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,750
这招太损了
That was a dirty trick.

470
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,120
那不是什么花招  是为了证实
That wasn't a trick -- it was a demonstration.

471
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,690
他对电流不过敏
This allergy to electricity isn't real --

472
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,280
只是某种深层情绪的表达
It's a manifestation of something deeper.

473
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,400
我没说百分百是真的  好吗
I'm not saying it's 100% real, okay?

474
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,890
但是查克比咱们俩加起来都聪明
But Chuck is smarter than you and me put together,

475
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,700
所以没办法说服他
so we're not talking him out of this,

476
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,080
我也不会让他住到橡胶室[治疗精神病]里
and I'm not sending him to a rubber room.

477
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,540
没人说要送到橡胶室
No one is talking about rubber rooms.

478
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,490
有专家能...
There are specialists who will --

479
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,930
他看过专家了
He's seen specialists, okay?

480
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,570
这里到丹佛最好的医生都看过
The best doctors from here to Denver,

481
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:22,900
没人能帮得上忙  谁也不行
and none of them helped -- not one.

482
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,480
所以你是打算放弃了吗
So you're ready to give up.

483
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,270
谁要放弃了
Who's giving up, huh?

484
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,240
一直是我在照顾他好吗
I'm -- I'm the one doing the heavy lifting here.

485
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,930
他说的无铅汽油灯--
That white gas he was talking about --

486
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,190
你觉得是谁给他的
who do you think brings him that?

487
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,030
还有牛奶  面包  厕纸
And milk and bread and toilet paper

488
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,830
冰块  他的一切必需品
and ice and every other damn thing he needs.

489
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,770
你是在帮他还是纵容他
Is that helping or enabling?

490
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,030
如果你在监护权听证会上作证
If you testify in a custodial hearing,

491
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,460
他就能得到需要的帮助  你有能力这么做
he can get the help he needs -- that's in your power.

492
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,370
非自愿被送入精神病院
To be committed involuntarily,

493
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,440
他必须对自己或他人构成威胁
he has to be a danger to himself or others.

494
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,810
他确实很危险
And he is.

495
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,070
室内用科勒曼汽油灯  便携炉
Coleman lanterns indoors, a camp stove?

496
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,600
他有可能把房子烧了
I mean, he could burn his house down

497
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,010
甚至把整个小区都烧着
or the entire neighborhood,

498
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,270
到时候他就得在精神病院呆十几二十年了
and then you're looking at a commitment of 10 to 20 years.

499
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,610
要是
What if --

500
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,860
要是他在家中伤了他自己怎么办
What if he just hurts himself in a household accident?

501
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,520
他怎么呼救
How does he call for help?

502
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,210
你有能力帮助你哥哥
You have the power to help your brother --

503
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,790
给他真正的帮助
truly help him.

504
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,250
你逃避不了这个现实
Ignoring this won't make it go away.

505
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,420
要是你你会怎么做
What would you do?

506
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,020
我只知道
All I know is...

507
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,100
他需要帮助
he needs help.

508
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,170
放了他
Untie him.

509
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,010
我要带他走
I'm getting him out of here.

510
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,770
护士会把出院登记表拿给你
A nurse will bring you the release forms.

511
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,940
总算来了
Oh, boy.

512
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,970
-吉米  吉米  -我找到他了
- Jimmy. Jimmy. - I found him.

513
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,310
我觉得我应该等你来
I thought I'd wait till you got here.

514
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,320
太好了  他怎么样了
Great. How's he doing?

515
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,710
好多了  正在休息
Better. Resting.

516
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,010
那就好
Good.

517
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,520
那个  吉米...
Uh, Jimmy...

518
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,080
我已经和地检官谈过了
I want you to know that I've talked to the D.A.,

519
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,700
他绝对不会在任何入院书上签字的
and he absolutely will not sign off on any commitment papers.

520
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,310
这是身体问题  不是精神上的问题
This is a physical condition, not a mental one.

521
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,950
查克心智很健全
Chuck is of sound mind.

522
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,760
在这一点上我们应该能达成一致
I think we can all agree on that.

523
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,660
你干得真好啊  霍华德
You're a real peach, Howard.

524
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,880
你当然不希望查克被送进精神病院
Of course you don't want Chuck committed.

525
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,450
是啊  我是不希望  我为什么希望
No, I don't. Why would I?

526
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,610
因为如果查克入院了
Because if Chuck were committed,

527
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,450
我就会成为他的法定监护人
then I'd become his legal guardian,

528
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,170
就可以让他从律所撤股了
and I cash him out of HHM.

529
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,530
天哪  吉米  你确定
Jesus, Jimmy. Now?

530
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,190
他还躺在那里  你真的要谈这个吗
You want to hash that out while he's lying in here?

531
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,900
日光浴床肯定把你脑子烧坏了
You know, the tanning bed must have melted your brain

532
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,990
如果你花一秒钟想一想
If you think for one second --

533
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,570
伙计们  我们的重点应该是查克
Guys -- Chuck. That's why we're here.

534
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,840
对  别跑题
Yes. Let's stay on point.

535
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,670
我们是在谈论一个人的健康问题
We're talking about the well-being of a man

536
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,660
我们都很爱他
whom we all love very much.

537
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,980
问题是有点复杂
There's many factors at play.

538
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,410
但请勿夹杂恶意
Spite doesn't have to be one of them.

539
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,510
知道吗  霍华德
You know what, Howard?

540
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,040
你没来之前我还在犹豫
I was on the fence till you showed up,

541
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,480
多谢你帮我做了决定
but thanks for helping me decide.

542
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,490
跟你的摇钱树说拜拜吧
Wave bye-bye to your cash cow,

543
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,450
因为你马上就会失去它了
'cause it's leaving the pasture.

544
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,150
我这就送他入院
I'm committing him.

545
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,460
吉米  等一下
Jimmy. Uh, J-- wait.

546
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,590
吉米  等等  吉米
Jimmy, wait. Jimmy.

547
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,000
吉米  等一下好吗
Jimmy, can you wait?

548
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,030
吉米  等等
Jimmy, wait a second.

549
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,980
听着  我知道查克需要帮助
Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help,

550
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,850
也许你确实应该这样做
and maybe it's the right thing to do,

551
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,380
但是你不能采取这种方式
but you can't do it like this.

552
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,970
我就想让那个杂种着急
I just want to see that son of a bitch sweat.

553
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,350
明眼人一看就知道他怕什么
It's so obvious what he's afraid of.

554
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,880
我要带我哥回家了
I'm taking my brother home.

555
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,610
到这边来  老哥
There you go, buddy.

556
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,330
这边
Yeah. There you go.

557
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,520
注意台阶  一步  两步
Okay, some steps. One and two.

558
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,930
往这边
And there you go.

559
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,270
你回家了
Hey, you're home, all right?

560
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,910
会没事的
Everything's gonna be all right.

561
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,060
想吃点东西吗
Uh, you want something to eat --

562
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,930
喝茶  喝杯茶吗
Uh, some tea -- a cup of tea?

563
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,360
-咖啡  -行
- Coffee? - Yeah.

564
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,400
咖啡  那就咖啡了
Coffee. Coffee it is.

565
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,250
吉米  我要我的...
Uh, Jimmy, I'm -- I'm -- I'm gonna need my...

566
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,410
我不...
I don't -- I-I-I-I...

567
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,450
它在...
Oh, it's...

568
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,350
行
Yeah.

569
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,950
想聊聊这事吗
You want to talk about this?

570
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,580
-没什么好聊的  -你拿了报纸
- There's nothing to talk about. - You took the paper.

571
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,600
你看到了
You saw this.

572
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,680
然后犯病了
You got sick.

573
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,270
你什么意思
What's your point?

574
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,860
查克  你犯病是因为看到这则新闻了吧
Chuck, I think you got sick 'cause you saw this story.

575
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,640
每次你觉得我做了坏事
No, w-- whenever you think I've done something wrong,

576
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,350
可疑的事  病情就更严重
something questionable, you get worse.

577
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,210
我犯病
I didn't get sick

578
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,980
不是因为看到你上了报纸
because I read about you in the paper.

579
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,650
我犯病
I got sick

580
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:32,140
是因为我出门取报纸
because I went out of my house to retrieve the paper.

581
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,670
我好累  不想吵了  吉米
I'm too tired for this argument, Jimmy.

582
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,460
都吵过那么多次了
I-I've had it too many times.

583
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,280
你以为我又变回风流吉米了
You think this is the return of Slippin' Jimmy,

584
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,430
-但其实没有  -好吧
- but it's not. - All right.

585
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,200
你觉得广告牌的事不道德
Uh, you think the billboard thing was unethical,

586
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,380
但这是...宣传
but it was...promotion.

587
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,860
这是广告  仅此而已
It was advertising -- that's all.

588
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:56,930
{\an8}贝茨对亚利桑那州律师协会案  允许律师公开打广告的首个修正案

589
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,620
在贝茨对亚利桑那州律师协会一案中
Which wasn't even allowed until five supreme court justices

590
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,930
五位大法官发了疯才允许律师打广告
went completely bonkers in Bates vs. State Bar of Arizona.

591
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,710
但不管怎样
But in any event...

592
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,800
这是合法的
it's legal.

593
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,970
你想打广告是你自己的事[生意]
If you want to advertise, that's your business.

594
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,860
"生意"是个关键词  查克
"Business" being the operative word there, Chuck,

595
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,080
因为打广告才有生意
because I-I have gotten business off of this --

596
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,290
合法的生意  订立遗嘱  接受委托
legit business -- wills, uh, trusts.

597
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,110
我开始专攻老年法案子
Uh, I'm -- I'm kind of starting to specialize in Elder law.

598
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,990
老年法
Elder law?

599
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,160
是  老年人要处理的事
Yeah, the things the elderly have to deal with --

600
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,330
比如亲戚觊觎他们的存款
I mean, you know, relatives coming after their savings,

601
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,000
电话推销员  反向抵押贷款诈骗
telemarketers, reverse-mortgage scams --

602
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,960
人老了很悲惨
I mean, getting old sucks.

603
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,470
老年人需要有人支持  所以...
Seniors need someone on their side, so...

604
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,950
我就是那个支持他们的人
You're looking at him.

605
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
听起来很...
Well, that sounds...

606
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,200
有前途
promising.

607
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,510
但跟我的病情没什么关系
But it has nothing to do with my condition.

608
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,150
查克  听我说  我现在向你承诺  行吗
Chuck, listen. I'm gonna make you a promise right now, okay?

609
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,890
不用  没必要  不强求
No, not necessary, not requested.

610
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,550
行
Okay.

611
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,440
广告牌的事就这一次
The billboard was a one-time thing.

612
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,080
我是名好律师
I-I-I'm a good lawyer.

613
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
我只是需要点噱头
I just needed some razzmatazz, you know,

614
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,070
一些技巧  才能行动起来
to get the ball rolling, some showmanship --

615
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,100
仅此而已
That's all it was.

616
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,720
不会有下次了
It's done now. It's over.

617
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,480
好吧
All right.

618
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,540
从今以后  我要规规矩矩
From here on out, I'm gonna play by the rules.

619
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,620
律师都该这样
As any lawyer should.

620
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,420
没错
Exactly.

621
