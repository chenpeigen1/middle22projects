谢了  吉米
Thanks, Jimmy.

20
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,330
-特瑞纳  -吉米你好
- Trina. - Hey, Jimmy.

21
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,900
你有个包裹  丹
Got a package, Dan.

22
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,280
今天怎么样
How's it going?

23
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,930
还好吗
What's up?

24
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,790
{\an8}哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,210
-你好啊  -好你个头
- Hey. - Hey, yourself.

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,600
吉米  我现在很烦  有话快说
Jimmy, I'm really slammed. Just tell me what you need.

27
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,090
这是什么
What is it?

28
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,880
我不敢打开
I can't open it.

29
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,450
写了什么
So, what does it say?

30
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,480
我必须请你注意
I must call to your attention

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
这项新通过的
the newly passed Environmental Impact

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,990
《环境影响与可持续发展保障法案》
and Sustainability Assurance Act,

33
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,040
如你所知  这条法案
a statute that, as you know, went into effect

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,360
没有任何溯及既往的条款就直接生效了
without any ex post facto provisions in place.

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,650
你有时间吗  查克
You got a second, Chuck?

36
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,830
没有  我现在有点
Not really. I'm-I'm kind of--

37
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,930
-一会儿就好  我保证  -好吧
- It'll just take two seconds. I promise. - All right.

38
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,720
这是什么
What's this?

39
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,960
你开玩笑吗
Is this a joke?

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,360
没有  这是真的
No. No joke.

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,140
你通过了律师资格考试
You, you passed the Bar?

42
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,850
是的  我通过了
Yeah. I did.

43
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,170
我想着如果金能考过  我应该也行
I-I thought if Kim could do it, maybe I can, too, you know?

44
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,860
所以我在一个社区大学修完了
So I got my last few credits for undergrad

45
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,260
本科的最后几个学分
from a community college.

46
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,670
不只是逃兵役的在那上课
I mean, they're not just for draft dodgers

47
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,320
上的课也不只有瑜伽
and yoga classes, all right?

48
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,990
后来我上了一所肯要我的法学院
Then I found a law school that would accept me.

49
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,550
虽然不是乔治城大学[最好的法学院之一]
You know, wasn't Georgetown or anything, but...

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,370
是美属萨摩亚大学
The university of American Samoa.

51
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,180
函授学校啊
Oh. Correspondence school.

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,610
我总不能辞职  对吧
Well, I wasn't gonna quit work, right?

53
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,820
就晚上  还有周末学习
Day-nights, weekends, you know?

54
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,370
他们现在把这叫做"远程学习"
They call it "Distance learning" nowadays.

55
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,730
但这是被承认的  加油  小地蟹
But they're accredited. Go, Land Crabs.

56
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,450
于是我就参加了函授学习
So, you know, I did that.

57
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,720
律师资格考试简直太难了
And the Bar exam's a mother.

58
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,070
至少对我来说很难
I mean, for me it was.

59
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,130
前两次考试我都挂了
I failed it the first two times,

60
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,350
但我觉得这就像失去你的童贞
but I guess it's like losing your virginity --

61
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,690
第三次总有好运
third time's the charm.

62
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,250
这肯定花了你很多年时间
How, this must have taken you years.

63
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,290
你却一直对我保密
And you kept it a secret all this time.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,880
你为什么不来向我求助
Why? You didn't come to me for help?

65
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,420
查克  你可是我认识的最忙的人
Jesus, Chuck, you're the busiest guy I know.

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,410
你每天都在做很重要的事
I mean, you're doing important shit.

67
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,290
我不知道说什么好了
I don't know what to say.

68
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,990
你为我感到骄傲吗
Well, are you proud of me?

69
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,140
当然了
Yes!

70
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,330
-绝对的  -谢谢
- Absolutely. - Thanks.

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,670
查克  这对我意义重大
Chuck, that means a lot.

72
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,070
我在想  如果你觉得合适的话
I was hoping, you know, if you think it's appropriate,

73
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,010
一旦我把宣誓什么的弄完了
once I get sworn in and everything...

74
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,300
你能考虑雇我吗
consider hiring me?

75
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,650
雇你来干嘛
As what?

76
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,730
律师啊
Oh. A-a lawyer.

77
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,850
当然了  肯定的
Obviously. Yeah.

78
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,050
我要和霍华德还有其它的合伙人
Well, that's a question I'm gonna have to take up

79
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,020
商量一下这个问题
with Howard and the other partners.

80
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,170
这不是我一个人能做的决定
You know, it's not my decision alone.

81
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,550
但他们怎么会拒绝呢
But how could they say no?

82
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,700
你是如此干劲十足
So much drive.

83
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,740
吉米  看看你的成就
Jimmy, look what you've done here.

84
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,770
{\an8}恭喜吉米

85
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,370
我跟他们说了要巧克力蛋糕
Oh, man. I told those guys devil's food.

86
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,480
我会替你告他们的
Yeah. Well, I will sue the store for you.

87
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,850
-很好  -苟富贵  勿相忘
- Good. - Just remember us when you're all big-time, huh?

88
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,660
我现在就忘记你了  巴特
I don't remember you now, Burt.

89
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,890
你代表的是我们收发室
You're representing mail room,

90
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,520
你这是告诉楼上那些混蛋...
so you show those upstairs jackholes how it gets--

91
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,480
大家伙在干什么呢  开派对吗
What are you folks up to? Having a party?

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,210
为这位新墨西哥州的新晋律师小小地庆祝一下
Just a little celebration on behalf of New Mexico's newest attorney.

93
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,280
我听说了  吉米  没看出来你还留了这手
I heard. Jesus, Jimmy, you're a regular Charlie Hustle.

94

-恭喜你  朋友  -谢谢

Would you like some cake?

96
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,040
-给你  -那我就不客气了
- Oh, here. - Uh, don't mind if I do.

97
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,630
你真的让我刮目相看  吉米
Really, really impressive, Jimmy.

98
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,910
我们都为你感到骄傲
We're all proud of you.

99
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,740
很抱歉打扰你们
Hey, I hate to interrupt.

100
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,840
我能和吉米单独说几句吗
But could you guys give Jimmy and me a moment?

101

谢谢理解  吉米
Thanks for understanding, Jimmy.

105
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,590
你想让我把门关了还是留着
You want the door open or closed?

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
关上吧
Closed.

挑张名片吧  随便挑
Hey, pick a card, any card.

139

好几年前就该弄好的
I should have done this years ago.

155
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,210
这种事大家都喜欢拖
Well, people do tend to put it off.

156
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,300
但每个人都该早点立下遗嘱
But everybody should have a will.

157
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,160
要告诉你的老年朋友哦
Please tell your friends.

158
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,510
一共是一百四十元
And that comes to $140.

现金和支票都可以
And I'm happy to take, uh, cash or a check

160
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,380
或者说  还是现金吧
or, uh...cash.

161
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,530
稍等一会
O-one moment.

162
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,560
你能给我写一张支票吗
Could you write me a check?

163
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,360
时间太久了
Well, it's been so long,

164
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,210
我...我不知道我户头上的钱够不够
I -- I-I really don't know if I have enough in my account.

165
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,750
实在很抱歉

166
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,320
实在是太糟糕了  但是...
Thi-- this is awful, but...

167
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,400
我只有四十三元
all I have is $43.

168
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,490
好吧
Okay.

169
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,140
我可以去找他们预支一点
Now, I could ask for an advance.

170
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,250
我真的很抱歉
I-I-I am so sorry.

171
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,110
没关系
It's fine.

172
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,060
我都不知道该说什么了  太糟糕了
I-I don't know what to say. This is awful.

173
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,670
遗嘱你可以先拿着  等我拿到津贴
You could keep the will until I get my allowance,

174
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,940
应该下礼拜就能拿到
and -- and that should only be until the end of next week.

175
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,420
没有那个必要  这是我的地址
Okay, that's not necessary. Here's my address.

176
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,610
你有钱了就寄给我  行吗
Just mail it to me when you've got it, all right?

177
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,910
我还是  还是收一百二吧
And why don't we, uh -- we'll just make it an even $120.

178
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,230
行吧
All right?

179
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,650
谢谢
Thank you.

180
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,700
生活愉快
You have a nice day.

181
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,690
不好意思  "津贴"
Excuse me. Allowance?

182
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,830
你家人还给你钱吗
Your family has you on an allowance?

183
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,040
不不不  是我的钱
Oh, no, no. It's -- it's my money.

184
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,620
由矶鹞渡发给我
I just get it from Sandpiper Crossing.

185
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,330
五百块一个月
$500 a month --

186
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,320
我不懂
I don't understand.

187
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,090
你应该有社保支票
You should have social security checks...

188
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,830
再加上我们之前说的养老金
plus that pension we talked about.

189
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,910
你怎么还需要津贴
So how are you on an allowance?

190
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,110
那些支票都寄给矶鹞渡
Well, the checks go to Sandpiper,

191
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,980
然后他们抽掉我的费用和开销
and then they take out my fees and -- and my expenses.

192
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,720
你还是进来吧
Why don't you just come on in?

193
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,470
我怕我解释得不够到位
I'm afraid I'm not explaining it very well.

194
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,740
我这里有个声明  在哪来着
I -- I have statements here...somewhere.

195
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,920
在哪  这里
Somewhere. Okay. Here...

196
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,970
所以你的养老金和社保
So your pension and social security

197
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,530
都是直接寄给矶鹞渡的人吗
goes straight to the Sandpiper people?

198
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,260
他们拿走他们需要的钱
They take out -- they take out what they need,

199
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,160
然后再给我发津贴
and then -- and then I get my allowance.

200
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,710
剩下的钱都打到我的储蓄账户里
And -- and all the rest goes into my savings account.

201
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,170
没什么猫腻
It's really all very above-board.

202
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,220
很多地方都这样子
A lot of places do it this way.

203
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,440
他们对这里每个人都这样吗
This is how they do it for everybody around here?

204
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,960
没错  他们这是在帮我们省事
Well, yes, they -- they try to make everything easy for us.

205
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,360
兰德里太太  你朋友在吗
Mrs. Landry, are any of your friends around

206
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,280
我想跟他们谈谈
who I could talk to?

207
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,630
我看到你花了...不知道你有没有注意到
I see you spent -- now, I don't know if you noticed --

208
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,600
187.5元花在4-10-12这条上
$187.50 on 4-10-12.

209
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
你知道4-10-12是什么吗
Do you know at 4-10-12 is?

210
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,540
不  想知道的话  你必须看背面
No. In order to find out, you have to look on the back.

211
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,090
好吗  看这个
Okay? And see this key.

212
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,950
我看到你戴了老花镜  能借我用一下吗
I see you have reading glasses. Can I borrow your glasses?

213
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,810
-可以  -谢谢你
- Yes. - Thank you.

214
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,010
这个可以帮到我
Oh, these are gonna help me,

215
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,170
但我不知道能不能看清楚
but I don't know if they'll do the trick.

216
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,210
字太小了
So tiny.

217
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,250
4-10-12...
4-10-12...

218
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,260
我想可能是棉签  我也说不准
I think it might be q-tips. I can't tell.

219
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,730
可能是个意外  不过我们该调查一下
It's probably an accident, but we should look into it.

220
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,890
你们认为呢
Don't you think?

221
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,930
他们不是故意这样做的
They're not doing this intentionally.

222
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,610
可能哪里出了错
Okay? This could be a mistake.

223
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,830
不过如果我们纠正这个错误
But if we correct the mistake,

224
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,580
你们就会拿回一些钱  那就公平了
then you'll get some money back, and it'll be fair.

225
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,970
查克
Hey, Chuck.

226
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,890
我的那些盒子  上次留在这的...
My boxes, the ones I left...

227
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,770
矶鹞渡...
Sandpiper Crossing...

228
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,650
矶鹞渡...
Sandpiper Crossing...

229
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,010
你做了我那些遗嘱吗
Did you do my wills?

230
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,090
是的  我做了
Yes, I did.

231
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,870
你能看看那个吗
Hey. Would you look at that?

232
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,650
-谢谢  -别谢我
- Thank you. - Don't thank me.

233
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,010
这事只有一次
This was a one-time thing,

234
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,080
别以为我看不出你想干什么
and don't think I don't see what you were doing here.

235
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,450
你想演《汤姆历险记》  想让我为你刷栅栏
You wanted to play Tom Sawyer, wanted me to paint the fence,

236
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,190
老天呐  我居然上钩了
and god help me, it worked.

237
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,340
你需要帮忙吗
You need help?

238
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,120
去雇一个助手  靠自己解决问题
Hire a para-legal, stand on your own two feet.

239
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,030
好的  我会的
Yeah. Sure. I'll do that.

240
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,960
你根本没在听我说话
You're not even listening to me.

241
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,990
不  我听见了  查克  行了吗
No, I -- I hear you, Chuck, okay?

242
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,040
自力更生  这样很好  你能看一下这个吗
Self-reliance. It's great stuff. Would you look at this?

243
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,460
不是说了你自己解决吗
What did I just say?

244
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,940
就看一眼  好吗  就这里
Ta-take a look, okay? Just right here.

245
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,380
你看到了吗
Do you see what I see?

246
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,850
我只要求你看一眼  求你了
All I'm asking is for you to take a look. Please?

247
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,840
"矶鹞渡..."
"Sandpiper Crossing..."

248
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,050
那是一间养老院  生活协助中心
It's a retirement home, assisted living.

249
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,280
这是他们寄给居住者的一张月结账单
It's -- this is one of their monthly invoices they send their residents.

250
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,880
我到底要找什么
What exactly am I looking for?

251
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,120
不需要什么惊天动地的东西
It's nohing earth-shaking.

252
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
只是一些小地方  类似...
Just little things, little things like --

253
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,820
类似这个
like this right here.

254
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,510
十四块付给118-62条
$14 for code 118-62.

255
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,970
118-62是什么
What's 118-62?

256
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,030
我也想知道
I wonder.

257
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,100
这怎么看得清  简直就是缩微胶卷啊
How could you even read this? It's like microfilm.

258
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,240
118-62是面巾纸
118-62 is facial tissue.

259
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,250
十四块钱买一盒纸巾
14 bucks for a box of Kleenex.

260
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,650
是的  我还找到了别的
Yeah, I found others.

261
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,960
三块五一卷厕纸
There's $3.50 for a single roll of toilet paper,

262
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,000
二十二块钱一瓶阿司匹林
22 bucks for a bottle of aspirin.

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,590
这很明显是过高收费
It's a clear pattern of overcharging.

264
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,000
单项数额不高  但是加起来钱就很多
Nothing huge, but it adds up to real money.

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,450
你看这个
I mean, here, look.

266
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,240
这个女人  上个月被敲了四百块钱
This woman -- she got soaked for like 400 bucks last month.

267
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,640
而且他们很明显
And there's a pretty solid attempt

268
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,160
想要掩盖事实真相
at concealment of that fact,

269
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,840
在我看来  这应该构成...
which to my way of thinking, makes it...

270
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,840
诈骗罪  这是我经手的吗
Fraud. This was in work I did?

271
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,720
是的  你一定是漏掉了
Yeah, you must have missed it.

272
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,900
查克  我运气很好  不是吗
Um, look, Chuck, I got lucky, right?

273
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,930
真的是时来运转了
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.

274
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,680
这可不是小规模企业  对吗
And this is no mom-and-pop outfit, okay?

275
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,700
我调查了一下
I dug around a little.

276
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,290
养老院是一家房地产投资信托公司所有
They're owned by some kind of real-estate investment trust.

277
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,750
还需要搜集更多资料  但很可能是个大案子
I'm working at getting more info, but this could be big.

278
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,940
这是个大案子  不是吗
I mean, this could be a big case, right?

279
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,500
如果不光是这些账单
Well...if it's more than a few errant billings

280
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,450
如果这是有组织的  而且你找到了运作模式
and if it's systematic and you establish a pattern,

281
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,660
可以提出集体诉讼
it could be class-action.

282
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,100
我该做什么  下一步该怎么办
What do I do now? I mean, what next?

283
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,660
你需要搜集更多的资料
Well, you're gonna need more information.

284
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,150
你也不想草率行事吧
You don't want to go off half-cocked.

285
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,730
我会做十足的准备
Full cock. Okay.

286
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,900
不  我要回去一趟
No, I -- I'm gonna head back there.

287
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,770
谢谢你  你是最棒的
Thank you. You're the best.

Okay. What gives?

291
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,240
抱歉  先生  新政策
Sorry, sir. New policy.

292
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,720
我们担心会有教唆[引诱]行为发生
We're concerned about solicitation on premises.

293
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,860
我不是小白脸  如果你在暗示这个的话
I'm not a gigolo, if that's what you're implying.

294
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,010
法律教唆
Legal solicitation.

295
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,000
我们有义务保护居住者不受骚扰
We're obligated to protect our residents from being harassed,

296
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,700
我们也有权利拒绝你进入
and we have the right to refuse entry.

297
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,600
这里有我的客户
I have clients in there.

298
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,590
现在他们有见我的合法权利
Now, they have the legal right to meet with me.

299
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,610
那你必须和他们安排在别处见面
Well, you'll just have to arrange to meet them elsewhere.

300
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,110
拜托  老兄  来真的吗
Oh, come on, guys. Seriously?

301
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,870
你们在这上演《超世纪谍杀案》吗
What, are you making Soylent Green back there?

302
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,070
好吧  好吧
It's -- all right, okay.

303
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,500
我走  行了吧
I-I'm backing away. Yeah?

304
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,620
你知道吗  这...
You know what? Uh...this --

305
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,530
他们俩把我推得肚子疼
Hey, this has gotten me a little bit stirred up down there.

306
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,000
用一下卫生间可以吗
Can I use your restroom?

307
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,870
求你了  我有肠易激综合征
Please, it's -- I've got I.B.S.

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,220
严重伤害了委托人的感情"
This is a negligent infliction of emotional distress."

317
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,720
先生  你上完了就赶快给我出来
Sir, I really need you to finish up and come out now.

318
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,870
"请在本周末前与我联系
"...contact by the end of the week

319
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,060
否则我将不得不采取必要措施"
"or I will be forced to move forward."

320
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,630
先生  你快给我出...
Sir, I need you to finish up --

321
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,830
这是律师函  现告知贵中心
This is a demand letter informing Sandpiper Crossing

322
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,740
你们涉嫌有组织诈骗我方委托人
of pending litigation for defrauding

323
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,790
收取过高费用  将遭到起诉
my clients through systematic overcharging.

324
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,860
你们在粉碎文件  以为我是聋子吗
You're shredding in there! I'm not deaf!

325
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,030
我都听见了  快给我停下
I can hear you! Stop right now!

326
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,860
这封律师函意味着正式进入法律程序
This here -- this makes it official, right?

327
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,500
如果你们再不停下来
If you don't stop shredding right now,

328
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,070
你们就是在破坏证据  用法律术语说
that's destruction of evidence -- spoliation!

329
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,040
就是销毁罪证  那可是重罪
That's what it's called, and it's a felony!

330
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,750
现在就给你的律师打电话  说是我说的
So call your lawyers right now and tell them I said that --

331
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,220
堂堂詹姆斯·麦吉尔先生
me -- James McGill esquire!

332
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,810
我告诉你们  你们会后悔的
I'm telling you guys, big mistake! Aah!

333
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,800
你现在不方便接电话吗
Am I calling at a bad time?

334
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,050
没  没有
No, not at all.

335
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,280
最近怎么样
How you doing?

336
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,840
不错  还过得去
Uh, pretty good. Getting by.

337
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,240
你呢
How about you?

338
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,820
凑合
Getting by.

339
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,560
听到你的声音我真高兴
It's good to hear from you.

340
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,620
是啊  我最近...最近事情很多
Yeah. I-I've been -- There's been a lot going on.

341
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,710
你知道的
You know how it is.

342
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,020
我知道
Yeah, I know.

343
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,270
是这样
Uh, listen.

344
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,500
我想让你帮我个忙
I was -- was hoping maybe you could do me a favor.

345
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,460
你能照顾一下凯莉吗
Do you think you could watch Kaylee?

346
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:50,340
{\an8}只收现金

347
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,000
后天我去值班的时候看着她就行
It'd be during my shift the day after tomorrow.

348
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,900
我也不想麻烦你  但保姆这次...
Look, I hate to ask, but my regular sitter's down --

349
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,330
你有任何需要尽管开口
Anything you need, I'll be there.

350
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,410
你那时能下班吗  不要影响你工作
You can get off work? I don't want to impose or anything.

351
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,860
没关系  什么时候都行
No. Anytime.

352
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,810
一点也不影响
It's not an imposition.

353
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,490
谢谢  太感谢了
Thanks. Appreciate it.

354
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,100
别客气
Yeah, no problem.

355
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,120
那就一点四十五分吧
At a quarter to 2:00?

356
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,680
好的
I'll see you then.

357
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,710
好
Okay.

358
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,430
真臭
Jesus!

359
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,440
快出来
Come on.

360
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,410
在哪呢
Where is it?

361
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,280
真他妈恶心
God damn it!

362
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,970
就是那样也没搞定
And it didn't even make it fit.

363
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,560
然后我就说  "我们还没有做完呢
And I'm like, "It's not like we're close to being done.

364
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,920
你就不能另找个人来做吗"
I mean, can't you get somebody else to do it?"

365
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,100
说的对
Right.

366
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,130
他们给的钱也太少了
They don't pay any of us enough for this shit.

367
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,900
然后我们就争论了很久
You know what? And it's going on and on and on.

368
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,210
我就说
And so I'm like,

369
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,010
"明明是你们的问题  怎么怪到我头上"
"Why are you making your problems my problems?"

370
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,110
就是  好像你的麻烦还不够多似的
Right. Like you don't have enough problems of your own.

371
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,110
没错  我就是这么说的
Exactly! That's exactly what I'm saying.

372
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,800
谢谢  但是他...
Thank you. But he just...

373
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,100
詹姆斯·麦吉尔
James McGill.

374
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,070
麦吉尔先生
Mr. McGill,

375
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,940
我是斯韦卡特和考科利公司的里奇·斯韦卡特
Rich Schweikart of Schweikart and Cokely.

376
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,730
我们是代理
We're the law firm

377
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,730
矶鹞渡生活协助中心的律所
representing Sandpiper Crossing Assisted Living.

378
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,970
您今晚过得怎么样
How are you this evening?

379
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,760
还不错  谢谢  你呢
Quite well, thank you. How are you?

380
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,580
我也不错
Doing fine. Doing fine.

381
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,160
很抱歉这么晚打电话  您现在方便说话吗
I'm sorry to call so late. Did I catch you at a bad time?

382
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,920
没关系  你说吧
No, no. No, it's fine.

383
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,120
可你为什么声音这么小
It's just that you're whispering.

384
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,850
我在看歌剧呢
I'm at the opera.

385
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,400
什么歌剧啊
Oh. What opera?

386
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,950
《魔笛》
Magic Flute.

387
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,680
莫扎特的啊  不错
Mozart! Lovely.

388
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,170
那我长话短说吧
Well, I'll try not to keep you.

389
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,830
今天我们收到了您的...一样东西
We received...something from you today,

390
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,770
我们不清楚这到底是什么
And we're not quite sure what.

391
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,640
是律师函
It's a demand letter.

392
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,690
但令我们迷惑不解的是  它怎么写在...
Well, it was a little confusing 'cause it was written on, uh...

393
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,590
我得以最快速度写完
Well, I had to write it quickly

394
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,440
因为你的委托人正试图销毁罪证
because your clients were in the process of destroying evidence.

395
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,510
麦吉尔先生  您是指用碎纸机粉碎文件吧
Mr. McGill, if you're talking about shredding documents,

396
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,660
那既不反常  也不违法
That's neither irregular nor illegal.

397
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,260
美国所有的公司都会碎纸
Every business in America does it.

398
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,210
你说的是碎纸  我说的是销毁罪证
You say potato, I say spoliation.

399
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,870
您还是给我解释下  什么销毁罪证
Maybe you should walk me through what you're alleging here.

400
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,780
律师函里已经写得很清楚了
I believe it's all in the letter.

401
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,370
我没说里面没有
Uh, uh, I-I'm not saying it's not,

402
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:57,730
但有点儿难读懂
but it's a bit hard to read.

403
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,920
下次我会用双层纸
Next time, I'd use double-ply.

404
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,430
咱们别太关注纸质  好吗
Let's not fixate on the medium, okay?

405
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,510
我们来讨论一下内容
Let's look at the message.

406
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,010
现在  你的委托人面临着虐待老人
Now, your clients are facing multiple counts of elder abuse

407
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,230
诈骗  不公平交易等多项指控
and -- and fraud and deceptive and unfair trade practices,

408
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,160
这还只是开始  知道吗
and that's just the start, okay?

409
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,250
我不是个爱打赌的人
I'm not a betting man,

410
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,240
但我打赌我会找到更多证据
but I bet the farm I'll find more.

411
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,130
麦吉尔先生  你跟查尔斯·麦吉尔是亲戚吗
Mr. McGill, are you related to Charles McGill?

412
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,850
他是我哥哥
He's my brother.

413
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,250
是吗  他最近怎么样
Yeah? How's he doing these days?

414
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,170
我不知道这有什么关系
I - I fail to see the relevance of this.

415
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,980
坦白讲  我打这通电话的唯一原因就是
Frankly, the only reason that I made this phone call

416
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,240
出于对查尔斯的尊重
was out of respect for Charles

417
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,300
而你可能跟他是亲戚关系
on the off chance that you might be related to him.

418
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,310
我的搭档建议最好的回应就是
My partner suggested that the best response

419
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,600
{\an8}地方法院可以惩处提起非正当诉讼的律师

420
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,600
根据第十一条法规对你进行惩处
would be to send a Rule 11 letter and have you sanctioned,

421
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,330
但我不想直接走那一步
but I didn't want to jump to that immediate length.

422
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,890
这样吧  你别吓唬我了
Hey, how about you stop trying to rattle my cage

423
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,240
请正面做出回应
and just, you know, respond to the merits?

424
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,710
这就是我的回应  麦吉尔先生
This is my response, Mr. McGill...

425
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,570
你威胁说要提起诉讼并非出于善意
You have no good-faith basis to threaten any litigation.

426
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,070
这是勒索  你我心知肚明
This is a shakedown, and we both know it.

427
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,480
如果你非要得寸进尺  我也没办法了
Now, if you push this any further, my hands will be tied.

428
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,220
抱歉在晚上打扰你
Sorry for interrupting your evening.

429
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,860
享受《魔笛》吧
Enjoy "The Magic Flute."

430
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,250
来吹我的魔力"长笛"吧
Blow my magic flute.

431
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,650
该死
Son of a bitch!

432
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,960
吉米  你在干什么
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

433
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,340
查克
Oh, uh, Chuck, um...

434
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,750
很抱歉我这个样子
Sorry to... show up like this.

435
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,060
我只是需要一个地方工作
I just needed space to work.

436
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,620
这都是什么
What is all this?

437
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,360
你在我的餐厅干什么
What have you done to my dining room?

438
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,120
他们在销毁证据  矶鹞渡那些人
They were spoliating -- the Sandpiper people.

439
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,110
他们不让我进去
They wouldn't let me in,

440
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,710
我能看到他们在粉碎文件
and I could see that they were shredding.

441
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,360
我写了律师函  并交给了他们
I wrote them a demand letter, and I gave it to them.

442
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,510
-你闯进了养老院吗  -是生活协助中心
- You broke in to a nursing home? - Assisted living.

443
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,790
你偷了他们的垃圾
And you stole their garbage.

444
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,760
-天哪  -不  垃圾桶在公共区域
- My god. - No, it was in public.

445
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,960
没有上锁  什么都没有
There was no lock, no nothing.

446
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,260
我把盖子打开  就在里面了
I just lifted the lid, and there it was.

447
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,540
这种情况下又没什么隐私可言
There's no reasonable expectation of privacy

448
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,120
难道不是吗
in that situation, is there?

449
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,900
如果流浪汉可以睡里面
You can't say it's private

450
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,680
那就不能称之为隐私
if a hobo can use it as a wigwam.

451
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,130
这是标准  不是吗
That's -- that's the standard, right?

452
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,280
如果动物或者流浪者可以进入的话
If animals or vagrants can get in?

453
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,260
差不多是这样的
More or less, yes.

454
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,870
所以这些都是合法的
Okay, so this is all legal.

455
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,360
完完全全合法的
I mean, it's completely above-the-belt legal.

456
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,650
我只需要弄清楚他们在试图掩盖什么
I just need to figure out what they're trying to cover up.

457
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,960
一般人不这么粉碎文件
You know, you don't shred like this

458
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,360
除非要隐瞒什么事  对吗
unless you got something to hide, am I right?

459
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,010
-也不一定  -得了吧  查克
- Not necessarily. - Oh, come on, chuck.

460
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,260
我这个律师出现
A lawyer shows up,

461
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,780
开始调查他们的小阴谋  之后就粉碎文件
starts figuring out their little scheme, and suddenly this?

462
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,500
这绝不是巧合  这里面一定有鬼
No, it's not a coincidence. It's in here.

463
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,990
至少不是横切的
Well, at least it's not crosscut.

464
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,990
{\an8}横切的纸张更细碎  更难阅读

465
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,840
我不会影响你的
Look, you won't even know I'm here, okay?

466
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,100
我只需要一个安静的地方
I just need some space and some quiet,

467
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,650
而且我弄完了就走
and I'll be out of your hair as soon as I --

468
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,520
停下停下  没关系的  你可以在这儿工作
Stop, stop. It's okay. You can work here.

469
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,340
谢谢
Thanks.

470
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,710
我不介意有人陪伴
I don't mind the company.

471
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,960
你需要一杯咖啡
You look like you could use a cup of coffee.

472
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,520
天哪  当然
Good god, yes.

473
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,860
我去煮咖啡
I'll put it on.

474
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,790
抬起来
Up, up. Up.

475
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,650
上帝啊
God's sweet sake.

476
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,420
太好了  你醒了
Oh, good. You're up.

477
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,460
天哪  查克  我睡了多久
Well, jesus, Chuck, how long have I been asleep?

478
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,960
查克  你怎么
Chuck, how did you...?

479
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,100
真不敢相信
I -- I can't believe this. Uh...

480
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,510
谢谢你  你真帮了大忙
Uh, thank you. This is a huge help.

481
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,570
我感觉就像是在暴风雪中铲雪
I felt like I was shoveling snow in a blizzard.

482
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,300
越来越明了了
Well, it gets better.

483
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,880
这是什么
What's this?

484
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,940
这就是确凿证据
It's your smoking gun.

485
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,890
这是  注射器的发票
It's a, uh... invoice for syringes.

486
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,390
没错  从哪里来的
Yes. From?

487
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:51,200
莫里西医疗用品  内布拉斯加州林肯市
Morrissey Medical Supply -- Lincoln, Nebraska.

488
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,510
-所以呢  -相信我
- So? - Trust me.

489
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,500
现在我们需要查看判例法
Meanwhile, we need to start pulling case law --

490
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,790
1961到1968年间
any precedent dealing with 18 U.S.C.

491
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,710
任何跟美国法典第18章相关的
1961 to '68.

492
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,100
也许查看1978年修订的《新墨西哥州法令》
Probably not a bad idea to pull 30.47.1

493
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,680
第30章第47节第1款也是个不错的主意
from NMSA...uh, 1978.

494
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,040
我其实觉得那没什么用
I don't think that's gonna play, really,

495
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,500
但对我们来说是个不错的开始
but it's a good opening salvo for us.

496
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,260
等一下  "我们"
Wait, "us"?

497
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,740
我们要一起处理这个案子吗
We're working together on this?

498
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,920
你来决定啊  吉米
Mm. That's up to you, Jimmy.

499
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,870
因为
'Cause --

500
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,120
好了
All right.

501
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,380
好了好了  开始工作吧
All right. All right. Let's get to work.

502
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,590
-我是金·韦克斯勒  -美女  你好啊
- Kim Wexler. - Hey, gorgeous.

503
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,610
一上来就甜言蜜语
Oh, man. Sweet-talking right out of the gate?

504
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,970
你想要什么  快说
You want something. Make it fast.

505
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,540
-我急着回家  -好
- I want to go home. - Okay, okay.

506
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,770
你能帮我在万律数据库里查个东西吗
Will you look something up for me on Westlaw?

507
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,080
求你了
Please?

508
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,200
还好我比较好说话
You're lucky I'm a pushover.

509
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,020
好了  说吧
All right. Hit me.

510
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,690
谢谢
Thank you.

511
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,820
塞迪玛控告因克士公司一案
Uh, anything on Sedima v. Imrex,

512
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,520
{\an8}均为促成《反诈骗和腐败组织法案》的经典案例

513
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,840
施莱辛格控告迪士尼一案

霍姆斯控告证券投资者保护公司一案
Holmes v. S.I.P.C. --

515
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,640
别急  慢点  迪士尼
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down. v. Disney.

516
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,510
还有霍姆斯控告证券投资者...
Holmes v. S.I.--

517
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,450
-保护公司  -对
- D.C.- Yeah.

518
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,050
还有1978年修订的《新墨西哥州法令》
And, uh, anything on 57.12.1-24

519
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,510
57章12节1到24款
NMSA, 1978.

520
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,200
好吧
Uh, okay.

521
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,240
你最好给我划个范围吧
It would help if I knew what you were looking for here.

522
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,780
没范围  我要所有信息
Anything, everything.

523
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,650
什么  你是让我光给你念摘要么
What? You want me to just read you the head notes or something?

524
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,570
不是  全打印出来  整个案子
No, no, print it -- full cases,

525
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,820
还有其他引用过这些案子的案例
and any cases that cite to those cases.

526
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,800
每一个援引过的案子都不放过
Shepardize like the wolf's at the door.

527
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,910
天呐  吉米  这得有好几千页呢
Jesus, Jimmy, that's gonna be thousands of pages.

528
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,930
求求你了
Pretty please with sugar on top?

529
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,520
你还欠我个人情呢
Come on. You owe me one.

530
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,660
没错  但这得忙好几个小时呢
Yes, I do, but this is gonna take hours.

531
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,920
-还有  谁出钱  -霍华德
- And who do I bill it to? - Bill it to Howard.

532
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,170
他的工号是
I still remember his code --

533
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,040
1933  刚好是希特勒掌权那年
1933, same year Hitler came to power.

534
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,150
呵呵  我才不能把账记我老板头上
You're not funny. I'm not billing it to my boss.

535
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,020
那记你头上吧  我回头还你
How about yours? I'll pay you back.

536
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,170
吉米  这可得三四百块呢
Jimmy, this is 300, 400 bucks worth of printing.

537
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,750
让会计发现了  我就别想干了
The accountants will find it and I'll get fired,

538
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,630
此路不通
which sounds fun and all, but no.

539
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,800
好吧  稍等
Okay. Hold on a sec.

540
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,800
金没有工号不能打印
Uh, Kim can't print without a code.

541
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,630
我能不能过去做些笔记  然后再回来
Should I go over there, take notes, and come back?

542
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,080
算了  那得抄到什么时候
No, no, no. It would take too long.

543
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,920
用我的吧  1868
Use mine -- 1868.

544
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,380
好吧
Yeah.

545
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,850
用1868  查克的工号
1868. Use that. It's Chuck's.

546
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,230
你要用查克的工号啊
You're using Chuck's number?

547
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,880
他本人知道吗
Does Chuck know you're using Chuck's number?

548
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,290
我们在一起研究个案子
We're working on something together.

549
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,890
记得打印好送他家去
And bring it over to his place after.

550
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,690
-非常感谢  -稍等  别挂
- You're a lifesaver. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

551
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,810
你俩一起研究案子吗
You're working a case together?

552
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,380
对  你别声张  这可是个大案子...
Yeah. Keep this under your hat, but it's gonna be huge --

553
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,040
很可能成为集体诉讼
maybe a class-action, even.

554
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,420
能弄到一百万甚至两百万呢
We think it'll settle for $1 million, maybe $2 million.

555
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,960
你俩咋合作呢
How does that work?

556
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,870
查克是哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所的合伙人
Chuck's a partner at HHM.

557
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:50,400
咋了
So what?

558
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,080
我对查克的合伙协议一清二楚
Look, I know Chuck's partnership agreement chapter and verse.

559
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,640
他可以和外人合作
He can work with outside parties.

560
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,910
那条约只适用于小案子
That clause is intended for small-time stuff,

561
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,850
无偿的案子
pro bono cases.

562
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,720
那又怎样  我就是为了公益
So? I'm bono. I'm very bono.

563
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,240
查克很牛逼的  他们不敢造次
Chuck's a rock star, okay? They'll work it out.

564
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,510
查克能行吗  上次我见他时  他...
And Chuck can handle this? Last time I saw him, he was --

565
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,450
上次他失控了  好吗
Last time you saw him, he wasn't himself, okay?

566
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,140
现在他能行
This is good for him.

567
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,360
你说好就好
Okay.

568
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,900
又咋了
What?

569
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,940
我也说不清  只是...
I don't know. I'm just...

570
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,860
算了  我们待会儿见
Whatever. I'll see you in a couple hours.

571
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,260
好  我们叫披萨了
Okay. We're ordering a pizza, okay?

572
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,760
给你留一块
I'll save you a slice.

573
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,900
你要是再把不同颜色混在一起
Now, you know, if you don't separate those,

574
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,630
最后就全成棕色的了
You're gonna end up with brown.

575
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,500
都在家吗
Hello?

576
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,870
在里面
We're in here.

577
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,990
我们在做泥塑呢
We're playing sculptor.

578
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,060
她就是米开朗琪罗再世  工作顺利吗
She's Michelangelina. How's work?

579
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,060
{\an8}文艺复兴著名雕刻家

580
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,720
没啥特别的  你俩今天咋样
Eh, you know -- work. How did it go?

581
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,500
她特别好  很乖
Kid's a dream. She's easy.

582
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,920
以后也要乖乖的哦
And you better stay that way.

583
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,570
玩得开心吗  宝贝
How you doing, sweetie? Huh?

584
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,730
我该走了
Well, I better be going.

585
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,960
别急  过会儿再走吧
Oh, wait. Hang on a sec, would you?

586
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,480
我有事想跟你聊聊
I want to talk to you about something.

587
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,800
怎么了
What's up?

588
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,310
这钱咋办啊
I want to know what I should do with this.

589
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,260
好几个星期了
I've been carrying it around for weeks,

590
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,040
我天天都随身带着
like holding on to it.

591
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,900
不管放哪儿  我都放心不下
Every place I put it feels wrong.

592
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,510
我原本想放到教堂奉献盘里  但...
I thought about putting it in the collection plate, but...

593
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,390
这样有点...  我也说不清
it seemed -- I don't know.

594
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,020
马蒂去世后  日子挺拮据
Look, with Matty gone, I have expenses,

595
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,580
靠他的抚恤金我们勉强度日  但...
and the death benefit helped, but...

596
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,800
我想问你的是
what I want to ask you is...

597
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,830
这钱能花吗
...can I spend this?

598
00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:00,150
史黛西  如果这笔钱
Stace, if this money helps you and Kaylee,

599
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,780
能够帮助你和凯莉的话
if it does a single good thing in this world,

600
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,890
你想怎么花就怎么花
then you spend every penny.

601
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,830
这下我放心了
That's a relief. It'll help a lot.

602
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,220
当然这只是杯水车薪
Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket.

603
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,090
我发誓  我知道的每个人都觉得不好用
I swear, everyone I know has had problems with them.

604
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,830
我就有一辆  控制引擎的电脑
I had one. The computer in the engine --

605
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,950
在经过落基山脉时锁死了
It locked in the middle of the Rockies.

606
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,700
对呀  它说引擎过热了什么的
Yeah, it decided I was overheating, and that was it.

607
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,260
一百英里都没有维修的地方
Yeah. I couldn't get it fixed for a hundred miles.

608
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,710
我只好把它拖到特鲁莱德去了
I had to have it towed to Telluride.

609
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,030
真是受够了
It was unbelievable.

610
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,840
不  是电脑芯片  是那个小...
No, it's -- it's the chip. It's the little...

611
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:48,230
对啊  花了八百多块  还不算...
Yeah, it's like 800 bucks, not counting...

612
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,920
人力
labor.

613
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,040
{\an8}莫里西医疗用品

614
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,990
小梅  我一会儿再打给你
Hey, Mel, can I call you back?

615
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,580
查克  矶鹞渡的人来啦
Chuck, the Sandpiper has landed.

616
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,740
先生们  我是吉米·麦吉尔
Gentlemen, I'm Jimmy McGill.

617
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,150
-欢迎  -里奇·斯韦卡特
- Welcome. - Rich Schweikart.

618
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,880
这是阿尔文·里斯  菲尔·杰尔根思
This is Alvin Reese. Phil jergens.

619
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,560
感谢光临
Thanks for coming.

620
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,870
我要请你们
Oh, whoa. I have to ask you.

621
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,210
把所有的电子设备留在车里
Uh, please leave electronics in the car --

622
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,890
笔记本电脑  手机  掌上电脑  手表
laptops, blackberries, palm pilots, watches.

623
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,750
凡是一碰就出声的都请留在车里
If you lick it and it goes bzzt, leave it here.

624
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,980
为什么
Why?

625
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,520
我哥哥查克有点过敏
My brother Chuck has a certain sensitivity.

626
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,030
是一种身体疾病
It's a medical condition.

627
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,980
这是来造访的代价
This is the price of admission.

628
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,440
我已经听说过了
Yeah, I heard about this.

629
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,010
放吧  没事儿的
Go ahead. It's fine.

630
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,420
好了
Here you go.

631
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,810
先生们  请随便坐
Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.

632
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,390
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

633
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,920
好的
All right.

634
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,520
查克  来吧  哥
Chuck. Come on, buddy.

635
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,630
我...
I...

636
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,230
我不知道自己还行不行
I don't -- I don't know if I can do this.

637
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,620
你当然行的  好吧
You -- oh, you can do this, all right?

638
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,050
这些人...
These guys...

639
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,180
那些人啥也不是  好吧
Those guys -- they're nothing. Okay?

640
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,190
他们是活塞队你就是公牛队
They're the Pistons, and you're the Bulls.

641
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,470
好啦
All right?

642
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,260
你要做的就是一脸严肃地坐在那儿
All you got to do is sit there and look intimidating.

643
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,050
他们已经很怕你了  他们应该被吓到
They're scared of you already, and they should be.

644
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,470
你可是查尔斯·麦吉尔啊
You're Charles McGill.

645
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,400
我们走吧  去打败他们
Let's go. Let's go get 'em.

646
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,720
您还记得我吗  查尔斯
Do you remember me, Charles?

647
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,660
我们做过联合辩护啊
We were on a co-defence --

648
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,280
教会甜甜圈诉阿蒙多拉
Church's Donuts v. Amendola?

649
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,910
天啊  快十年前的事儿了吧
It was -- jesus -- 9, 10 years ago.

650
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,300
对啊
Yeah.

651
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,580
我们的客户起诉那些人
Oh, our guys were suing the other guys,

652
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,160
那些人又反过来起诉我们
and they were suing us right back,

653
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,830
再加上市政厅对我们都有不满
and the city had some grievance with everyone,

654
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,740
我们不得不四项诉讼合并
so we had to bundle like four actions together,

655
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,740
当时我以为我们完了
and I was sure that we were sunk.

656
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,840
但是您  您引用了什么来着
But you -- you quoted... what was it?

657
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,300
艾迪斯敦钢管厂
Huh? Addyston Pipe & Steel.

658
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,680
您把官司导向了反垄断
You turned it all antitrust,

659
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,600
然后这官司赢得了简易判决
and the whole thing went away in summary judgment.

660
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,620
太棒了  太棒了
It was amazing. It was amazing.

661
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,130
我还想有一天您一定会在最高法院辩护呢
I figured you'd be arguing in front of the supreme court someday.

662
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,700
好吧  很高兴见到你
Well, it's, uh, good to see you.

663
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,920
好的
Yeah.

664
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,160
好吧  我们谈正事儿吧
All right, well, let's get started.

665
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,600
我们读过了你修改过后的律师函
Um, we've read your revised demand.

666
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,480
真是一长串啊  很有创意
It's, uh, quite a laundry list. Very creative.

667
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,070
是啊  很有创意  你们的客户
Yeah, creative, like the way

668
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,740
搜刮那些老人的方式也很有创意
your clients have been billing my clients.

669
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,360
像达利[著名画家]般的超现实创意
'Cause that's like Salvador Dalí Creative.

670
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,080
说得好  但是你说的是站不住脚的
That's cute. Y-you know, you're not gonna make this stick.

671
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,490
先不说垃圾堆里的"证据"
Setting aside evidentiary concerns --

672
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,800
你们连十块钱一把的锁都买不起吗
Whoa, whoa. Your guys couldn't afford 10 bucks for a padlock?

673
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,870
这是他们的问题  那是公共财产
That's on them. Public property.

674
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,060
或许有的法官会像你这么想
Maybe a judge sees that your way, maybe he doesn't.

675
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,060
但是想要以虐待老人索赔
But the damages for elder abuse?

676
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:07,100
法律要求必须存在不当胁迫
The statute requires proof that there was some undue influence --

677
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,570
矶鹞渡的老人必须受到威胁才行
Someone threatening the residents of Sandpiper Crossing.

678
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,440
据我所知
As far as I understand it,

679
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,080
没有老人声称有人拿刀威胁他们
no one has claimed there's a guy with a knife

680
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,140
叫他们把午餐钱交出来
telling them to hand over their lunch money.

681
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,500
外面是有很多名声很差的
There are a lot of assisted-living facilities

682
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,940
生活协助中心
out there that may be disreputable,

683
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,790
但我们的客户不是  一点都不是
but that's not the case with our client, not even close.

684
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,210
他们所有的中心  全部十二个
All their facilities -- all 12 of them --

685
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,480
每一所都是五星级的
every single one, five-star rated.

686
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,800
你现在随便去一家
You go to any one of them right now,

687
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,470
知道你会看到什么吗
and you know what you'll see?

688
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,670
你会看到幸福健康的老人们
You'll see happy, healthy residents.

689
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,350
矶鹞渡把他们照顾得很好
Sandpiper takes care of these people.

690
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:31,660
没有蒙骗他们
They don't bilk them.

691
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,960
然而我们还是做了调查
But we looked into it,

692
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,940
你的有些客户确实被多收了钱
and some of your clients have, in fact, been overbilled.

693
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,490
这只是审计出了错
It's -- it's an accounting error.

694
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,630
并没有到诈骗的程度  完全没有
It doesn't rise to the level of fraud, not even close.

695
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:46,550
我们算了下损失  共计46320元
We've calculated the damages. All told, it's $46,320.

696
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,900
我们准备这样做
Mm-hmm, so here's what we're prepared to do.

697
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,800
我们会还你的客户一个公道
We're gonna make your clients whole --

698
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,000
一张支票用于支付那四万六千多
A check for the $46,000 and change right now.

699
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,950
另外
And on top of that,

700
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,060
我们还会支付你四万六千美元作为补偿
We'll give you another $46k to cover your expenses.

701
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,430
一共是多少  九万两千美元
So what's that? $92,000?

702
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,880
凑个整  十万美元
Let's call it $100,000 even.

703
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,290
我们没有犯罪
We admit to no wrongdoing,

704
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,290
你的委托人也撤销所有控告
and your clients release all claims.

705
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,070
我认为你们得再好好考虑一下
I think you're gonna need to do better than that.

706
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,440
你在你的律师函里提到过
Ah, this was in your demand letter.

707
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,700
是注射器  有什么问题吗
They're syringes. So?

708
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,110
不知道你是否了解
I-I don't know if you know this,

709
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:31,180
这是生活协助中心一项标准收费项目
but that's a pretty standard item in an assisted-living facility.

710
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,530
没错  不过问题不在器材本身
Correct. But it's not what it is that matters.

711
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:34,880
而在于这些器材的来源
It's where it's from.

712
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,400
内布拉斯加州  林肯市
Lincoln, Nebraska.

713
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,820
{\an8}内布拉斯加州居民的绰号

714
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,820
上啊  内布拉斯剥皮机
Go, Cornhuskers.

715
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,910
既然你没搞明白我的意思
Well, since you're not picking up what I'm putting down,

716
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,230
那就让我来解释一下
I'll explain it to you.

717
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,040
内布拉斯加  虽然都是"N"打头的
Um, Nebraska, although they both begin with the letter "N,"

718
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,280
但实际上它和新墨西哥州却是两码事
actually turns out to be a different state than New Mexico.

719
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,890
所以说你的客户为了做生意
So your client accepted shipments

720
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,530
接受跨州界运货
across state lines for its enterprise.

721
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,550
竟然还是通过美国邮政
I-in the U.S. Mail, no less.

722
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,970
{\an8}RICO  反诈骗腐败组织集团犯罪法

723
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,970
你是想把它当成诈骗案处理吗
Are you trying to make this a RICO case?

724
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,430
{\an8}美国犯罪团伙头目

725
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,430
你以为我们的客户是约翰·高蒂吗
Like our client is John Gotti or something?

726
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,440
你我都清楚
Well, you know as well as I do

727
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,020
RICO主要适用于商业案件
RICO's used mostly for business beefs.

728
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,500
塞迪玛一案降低了
Sedima establishes a pretty low threshold

729
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,640
RICO的适用门槛
for RICO provisions to kick in.

730
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,700
你们这是违法跨州界贸易哦
Interstate commerce is a bitch, huh?

731
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,140
我们一旦确定了...
As soon as we establish a pattern to --

732
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,460
你们管它叫什么来着  "额外收费"
What was your word? Uh, "Overbillings"?

733
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,270
我更喜欢用传统术语"诈骗"
I prefer the classic term of "Fraud."

734
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,020
你们将面临三倍损害赔偿
You're looking at treble damages.

735
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,620
你出的十万块算什么
So your 100 grand --

736
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,760
这下应该站得住脚了吧
I think you know where you can stick it.

737
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,660
能给我们几分钟吗
Will you give us a moment?

738
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,960
这样吧
Well...

739
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,930
你们给个确切的数
What number exactly did you have in mind?

740
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,790
两千万美元
$20 million.

741
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,270
-你说什么  -你已经听到了
- Excuse me? - You heard me.

742
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,960
-你别指望着...  -两千万  美元
- Oh, you can't expect - $20 million.

743
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,330
要不就法庭见
Or we'll see you in court.

744
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,190
两千万
$20 million?

745
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,220
你没听他们说吗
Didn't you hear them?

746
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,330
这可是个大公司  十二个分中心
This is a big company. 12 separate facilities.

747
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,070
不可能全在新墨西哥州
They can't possibly all be in New Mexico.

748
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,460
这很可能是一个跨州的
This is potentially a multi-state

749
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,030
联邦集体诉讼案件
federal class-action lawsuit

750
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,360
在定罪阶段还有RICO助力
with a RICO kicker at the penalty phase.

751
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,320
两千万还是客气的
$20 million? That's conservative.

752
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,860
现在我们要从集体诉讼确认入手
Now, class cert -- that's where we start.

753
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,840
我来起草诉状  尽量搞定有条件的
I'll draft our complaint, try to get us a conditional one.

754

他们会想办法突破
They'll try to pierce it,

755
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,170
但是应该能拖到他们被强制要求吐露实情
but it should hold long enough to start discovery.

756

我们得先解决你的问题
And we need to get you back on the grounds,

要我说那些人就该下地狱
Those people can go straight to hell, as far as I'm concerned.

771
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,110
还有什么需要帮忙的吗
Anything else I can do for you?

772
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,480
你和那些人还有联系吗
You still in touch with your people?

773
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,770
那得看你想找什么样的工作
Depends on the type of work you're looking for --

774
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,300
你能做的  不能做的  想做的  不想做的
Your dos, your don'ts, your wills, your won'ts.
