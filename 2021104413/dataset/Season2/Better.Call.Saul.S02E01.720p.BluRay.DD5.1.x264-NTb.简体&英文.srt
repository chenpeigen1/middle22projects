好久不见*
My, it's been a long, long time

28
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,650
你问我最近如何*
*How am I doin'?

29
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,200
我觉得还凑合*
*Oh, I guess that I'm doin' fine

时光飞逝*
*It's been so long now

32
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,680
你想让镜子里的这个人为你服务吗

33
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,130
感觉却像*
*And it seems that

34
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,100
只是昨日*
*It was only yesterday

35
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,900
时光飞逝*
*Gee, ain't it funny

36
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,340
真是可笑*
*How time slips away

37
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,360
我该走了*
*Gotta go now

38
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:14,710
改日再见*
*Guess I'll see you around

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,210
却不知何时能再见*
*Don't know when, though

40
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:27,360
不知我何时回到镇上*
*Never know when I'll be back in town

41
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,580
晚安  女士们  路上小心
Good night, ladies. Get home safe.

42

但请记得*
*But remember

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,600
我曾说过*

总有一天*
*That, in time,

45
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,270
你会付出代价*
*you're gonna pay

46
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,670
时光飞逝*
*And it's surprising

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,290
真是惊讶*
*How time slips away

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,590
不不不
No, no, no, no!

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,380
该死
God damn it!

50
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,500
不  别这样
No! Oh, c-come on.

51
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,620
来人啊
Somebody!

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,610
紧急出口
打开这扇门

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,420

Just "Jimmy." And it's a pleasure to meet you, Clifford.

63
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,650
幸会  我们知道你为矶鹞渡一案做出的努力
Likewise. We know all about your work on Sandpiper.

64
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,090
是团队成果
Well, it's a group effort.

65
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,590
哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所的人
I mean, the folks at HHM

66
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,470
做得非常好
are just knocking it out of the park.

67
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,520
如果没有你  也就不会立案
Well, you know, the case wouldn't exist without you.

68
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,610
当然
Absolutely.

69
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,900
一旦他加入你的团队
Once you get him on your team,

70
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,850
就知道我为什么叫他"骗子查理"了
you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."

71
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,770
吉米  他们是我的律师
Jimmy, these are my associates --

72
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,590
布莱恩·阿楚莱塔和艾琳·布里尔

-很高兴认识你们  -幸会
- Nice to meet you both. - It's great to meet you.

74
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,410
非常抱歉
I hate to do this,

75
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,740
但我能跟韦克斯勒小姐单独说句话吗
but, um, could I borrow Ms. Wexler for a moment?

76
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,340
失陪一下
If you will excuse us?

77
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,790
失陪
Pardon me.

78
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,290
怎么回事
What's going on?

79
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,460
我
I just, um

80
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,540
听着  是这样
Listen, here's the thing.

81
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,110
如果我接受这份工作  是否意味着我俩...
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...

82
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,820
我是说...
I mean, uh...

83
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,480
是否意味着...
Does it mean, uh...

84
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,170
什么  你到底想说什么
What? What -- what the hell is this?

85
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,860
如果我今天接受戴维斯梅因律所的工作 
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main,

86
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,640
是否意味着你和我...
does that mean that you and me...

87
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,920
能成吗
Is this -- is this gonna happen?

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,520
吉米  我...
Jimmy, I...

89
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,740
我...
I...

90
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,880
这两件事没有任何联系
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.

91
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,170
完全无关吗
Nothing at all.

92
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,780
无关
No.

93
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,400
当然无关了  为什么会有呢
Of course not. Why would it?

94
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,210
好吧
Great.

95
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,860
非常抱歉
Oh, sorry about that.

96
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,940
我想说  衷心感谢你们
Listen, I just wanted to say thank you sincerely

97
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,130
考虑我
for your interest in me.

98
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,940
这是我的荣幸
It's a honor to be considered,

99
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,840
但是现在  尤其是现在
but at this time...at this time,

100
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,890
我想我还是不加入了
Um...I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.

101
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,110
非常感谢
Thanks.

102
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,560
谢谢你  霍华德
Thank you, Howard.

103
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,960
吉米
Jimmy.

104
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,380
挺快啊
That was quick.

105
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,650
不收费
No charge.

106
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,050
帮我想想
Help me out here.

107
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,710
我是在做梦
Did I dream it?

108
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,860
还是我办公桌上真的有一百六十万美元现金
Or did I have 1.6 million dollars on my desk in cash?

109
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,980
地球上没人知道我们有这钱
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.

110
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,670
我们可以五五分成
We could have split it 50/50.

111
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,030
我们本可以每人带八十万美金回家  不用交税
We could have gone home with $800,000 each, tax-free.

112
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,250
你想说什么
Your point being?

113
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,270
我们为什么没那么干
Why didn't we?

114
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,140
我记得你说  要做对的事
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.

115
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,260
你想知道我为什么没拿那钱吗
You want to know why I didn't take that money?

116
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,860
你是想问这个吗
Is that what you're asking?

117
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,240
没错  我是想问那个问题
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

118
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,380
对我个人来说  别人雇我干活
Me, personally -- I was hired to do a job.

119
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,670
我干完了  就结束了
I did it. That's as far as it goes.

120
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,850
是的
Yeah.

121
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,690
我知道是什么阻止了我
Well, I know what stopped me.

122
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,270
听好了
You know what?

123
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,750
它再也不会阻止我了
It's never stopping me again.

124
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,700
你们好  女士们
Chao chi c'ung, ladies.

125
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,090
你们好
Chao chi c'ung.

126
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,160
阮女士  外面天气很好
Mrs. Nguyen, it's beautiful day out there.

127
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,770
你偶尔也要出去一下
You should get out of this place once in a while, you know.

128
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,300
扔扔飞盘什么的  散散心
Throw a Frisbee, have some fun.

129
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,970
我要经营生意
I have a business to run.

130
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,860
不  不对
Uh, no.

131
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,270
是生意在"经营"你呢
The business is running you.

132
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,550
听我的
Listen to me.

133
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,170
你以后会感谢我的
You'll thank me later.

134
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,470
只有顾客才能享用黄瓜水
Cucumber water for customer only!

135
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,510
詹姆斯·麦吉尔律所

136
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,310
喂  是我啊
Hey! It's me!

137
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,720
天啊  听得见吗
Geez. Hello?

138
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,880
嘿
Hello?

139
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,070
是我啊  我买了新车
It's me. I got a new car.

140
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,340
你喜欢吗
You like it?

141
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,460
我们不能开这个去碰面
We're not taking that to the meet.

142
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,280
那我们怎么去呢
How are we gonna get there?

143
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,140
我来开车
I'll drive.

144
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,470
开我的车
My car.

145
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,810
为什么
Why?

146
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,120
这桩生意要求克制
This business requires restraint.

147
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,420
但这车恰恰相反
That is the opposite of restraint.

148
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,780
但是我喜欢它
But...I like it.

149
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,550
我是说  我为它自豪
I mean, I'm proud of it.

150
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,220
好的
Good.

151
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,850
那你一个人自豪去  别拉着我
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.

152
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,600
我拒绝上车
I'm not getting in that.

153
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,070
好吧  那  那就别上车了
Okay. Then -- then don't.

154
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,890
实话说  你也没干什么
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.

155
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,600
你只是站在我背后而已
I've been paying you the salary of three people

156
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,520
我就要付你三人份的报酬
to just stand behind me.

157
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,930
而且  而且最近几次交易
You know? And -- and these-- these last few deals --

158
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,450
这个叫纳乔的  他都是一个人来的
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.

159
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,220
如果他不需要带人
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men,

160
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,010
那我为什么要带你呢
then, I mean, why do I need you?

161
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,100
我应该一个人去
I should just go alone.

162
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,290
不然我就浪费钱了
I'm throwing -- I'm throwing away money.

163
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,450
跟扔垃圾堆里一样
Just tossing it away. Into the trash.

164
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,390
随你怎么办
Look, you do whatever you want,

165
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,700
但是我建议你  如果没有人跟着你
but I'm advising you -- do not go to that meet

166
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,790
别一个人去
without someone watching your back.

167
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,400
是啊  你当然会这么说了
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.

168
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,160
你才不想失去这份轻松赚大钱的工作
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.

169
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,610
不过抱歉  这个肥差
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train,

170
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,300
马上就要溜走了
and it's leaving the station right now.

171
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,720
所以最后一次机会
So last chance.

172
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,320
上车
All aboard.

173
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,720
我说真的  最后一次机会
Seriously, last chance.

174
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,400
我数到十  然后我就...
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...

175
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,940
好  那行
All right, then.

176
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,770
你的服务到此为止了
Your services are no longer needed!

177
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,190
你好
Hola.

178
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,650
老头子没来
No old guy?

179
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,990
怎么  他是扭到腰了还是怎么了
What, did he break a hip or something?

180
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,410
是啊
I know, right?

181
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,940
不过不是的  我们...
Yeah, no, we, uh...

182
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,720
我们散伙了

"不干法律了"是什么意思

248
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,700
感谢你的解释  吉米

250
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,450
这里是印错了吗
Uh, is that a misprint right there?

251
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,570
一定是印错了
It's got to be, right?

252
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,800
-陈年蓝宝石吗  -是的
- The Zafiro Añejo? - Yeah.

253
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
没印错  真的
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.

254
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,720
老天爷  一杯龙舌兰要五十美金吗
Holy shit. A $50 shot of tequila?

255
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,060
-值吗  -当然
- Is it worth it? - Apparently.

256
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,200
不过也看个人喜好了
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.

257
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,330
这辈子一定得尝尝五十美金的龙舌兰
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila,

258
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,820
两杯  纯的
so, uh...two -- dos -- neat.

259
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,710
能跟房费一起结  对吗
And, uh, we can charge that to the room, can't we?

260
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,010
不  不用  我们
No, we can't. We...

261
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,750
我来付
I am paying.

262
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,600
给他一杯这里最便宜的
And he will be having a shot of your well brand,

263
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,470
我要一杯普通红酒
and I'll have a glass of your house red.

264
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,230
我们有解百纳  比诺和西拉

265
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,990
都可以

266
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,510
有酒精就行
Something with alcohol.

267
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,550
没问题
You got it.

268
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,340
吉米  在西塞罗市发生了什么
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?

269
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,440
为什么西塞罗市一定要有事发生
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?

270
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,560
因为我跟你说起戴维斯梅因律所时
Because when I talked to you about Davis & Main,

271
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,840
你都准备好接受那份工作了
you were ready to take the job.

272
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,610
现在你回来了  突然要放弃法律工作
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law,

273
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,880
在酒店骗喝昂贵的酒
cheating hotels out of expensive liquor,

274
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,340
带一个奇怪的尾戒
wearing a weird pinkie ring?

275
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,870
怎么  加入黑手党了吗
What, are you in the mafia now?

276
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,590
还问我们有没有未来
Asking if we have a future.

277
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,830
到底怎么回事
I mean, where did that come from?

278
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,210
我不知道  只是
I don't know. I just...

279
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
西塞罗跟这没关系
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.

280
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,140
是我的人生
It's my whole life.

281
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,980
从查克让我来到阿尔布开克开始
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.

282
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,450
自从我来到这儿
Ever since I got here,

283
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,150
我所做的一切都是为了让查克高兴
all I've done is try to make Chuck happy,

284
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,860
使出浑身解数来讨好查克
bend over backwards to please Chuck.

285
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,480
查克  查克  查克  再也不这样了
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck. Well, no more.

286
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,590
你放弃从事法律  这不正是查克想要的
You quitting the law -- isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?

287
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,960
谁在乎呢
Who cares?

288
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,180
这是为了我自己  好吗
This is for me, okay?

289
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,760
因为各种错误的原因  我开始从事法律
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.

290
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,610
我相信自己的直觉
I'm trusting my instincts.

291
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,040
我的才华还是发挥在别处比较好
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.

292
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,640
在哪儿  漂在别人的泳池里吗
Where? Floating in somebody else's pool?

293
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,430
吉米  你是个了不起的律师
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.

294
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,780
为什么要放弃
Why give that up?

295
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,460
也不是说我不享受做律师
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments,

296
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,730
只是我所喜欢的事
but the stuff I liked about it --

297
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,640
说服别人  让别人信服
selling people, convincing people --

298
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,170
不当律师也可以做到
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.

299
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,300
还有  我知道别人怎么看我
Besides, people tell me how they see me,

300
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,770
他们并不把我当律师
and it's not as a lawyer.

301
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,860
这是您要的酒
All right. Here you go.

302
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,720
谢谢
Thank you.

303
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,050
还需要什么随时叫我
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?

304
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,100
波比  怎么样  伙计
Bobby, what up, brother man?

305
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,030
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

306
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,190
做空
Short it.

307
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,230
做空
Short it.

308
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,960
做空  把那垃圾做空
Short it. Short that shit.

309
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,040
那支股毫无价值  没有前途
That stock is useless. It's got no legs.

310
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,990
就像马戏团的怪咖  但一点都不搞笑
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.

311
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,920
那支更糟糕  谁跟你推荐的
And that one's even worse. Who's giving you these?

312
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,710
帮我一个忙  拿个枕头
Please do me a favor. Take a pillow,

313
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,750
放在那支股票的脸上
put it over that stock's face

314
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,230
直到你听到垂死呻吟
until you hear the deathbed queef.

315
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,710
-是个赔钱货  -好吧
- It's a loser. - Okay, so...

316
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,320
如果你不做律师  要做什么
if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?

317
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,880
漂着等矶鹞渡的钱到手吗
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?

318
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,700
-不  -那可能要好几年
- No. - That could take years.

319
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,910
矶鹞渡跟这没关系
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.

320
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,210
这个有前途
Yeah, it's got legs.

321
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,520
那好  有什么计划
Okay, then, what's the plan?

322
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,050
用开放的心态迎接未来
To be open to the universe.

323
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,270
那就是没计划
Okay, so no plan.

324
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,730
随心所欲
Just walk the Earth,

325
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,530
像《低俗小说》结尾的朱尔那样吗
like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?

326
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,050
无论未来给我什么
Look, whatever the universe presents,

327
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,390
无论有什么样的机会  我都会接受
whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.

328
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,540
-无论什么样的机会吗  -是的
- Whatever opportunity? - Yeah.

329
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,660
戴维斯梅因律所不是一个机会吗
Wasn't Davis & Main an opportunity?

330
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,800
是非常好的机遇  但你放弃了
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.

331
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,430
不是他  不是那个人...
Not him, not the guy who...

332
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,040
拒绝前难道不该至少试一下这份工作吗
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?

333
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,250
浪费所有人  包括我自己的时间
And waste everyone's time, including my own?

334
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,480
金  谢谢你的关心  但那不适合我
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.

335
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,530
我不想要
I don't want it.

336
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,910
吉米  你记得你为司法考试学了多久
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?

337
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,330
你有多用功
How hard you worked?

338
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,250
所有努力都付之一炬吗
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?

339
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,600
这是沉没成本谬误
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

340
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,800
认为已经花了很多时间  金钱和精力的事就应该继续下去

341
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,800
什么
W-- The what?

342
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,160
沉没成本谬误  是赌徒行为
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost -- it's what gamblers do.

343
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,900
赔了夫人又折兵
They throw good money after bad

344
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,870
以为自己运气好  能回本
thinking they can turn their luck around.

345
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,690
我已经花了这么多钱和时间
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time --

346
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,790
无论怎样我都得继续
whatever, I got to keep going!"

347
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,300
但游戏最后是没有回报的
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.

348
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,010
你错了
You are making a mistake.

349
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,510
我知道你错了
I know you're making a mistake.

350
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,810
我这些年一直在做所谓正确的事
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now,

351
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,820
但我落得什么下场  糟透了
and where has it gotten me? Nowhere.

352
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,250
抱歉  我不...
I'm sorry. I don't...

353
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,030
我没点
It's not my thing.

354
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,550
我不懂
I don't get it.

355
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,430
-我就是不懂  -这才是对的事
- I just don't get it. - It's what's right for me.

356
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,640
扯淡
Donkey balls.

357
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,610
纯粹扯淡  伙计
Pure donkey balls, dude.

358
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,720
华尔街是废柴待的地方
Wall Street's for suckers.

359
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,240
谁吃饱了撑的想去那儿啊
Who needs that aggravation?

360
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,630
如果股神巴菲特不非得待在那儿
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there,

361
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,090
那我肯定不去
then I sure as hell don't.

362
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,490
我坐马桶上  用手提电脑就能交易
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop

363
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,710
一百万美元的股票
sitting on a toilet.

364
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,300
就像麦德斯往我王座上拉金砖
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.

365
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,300
麦德斯  传说能点石成金的人

366
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,520
所以斯皮尔格曼和戴伊奇才这么想要我的生意
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.

367
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,500
我是大金主
I'm a golden God.

368
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,120
我当然记得  谁会忘记那种事
Look, of course I remember that. Who forgets a thing like that?

369
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,680
那种屁话是被压抑弱势群体的愤怒
That fart had the anger of a repressed minority community.

370
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,760
你当着谁的面放这种屁
You fart like that in someone's face,

371
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,710
他下辈子准得红眼病
you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.

372
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,860
聊得很愉快  伙计
Good convo, bro.

373
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,820
下次再说  兄弟
Till next time, brutha-man.

374
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,810
跟我来
Come with me.

375
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,400
-什么  -来就好  相信我
- What? - Just come on. Trust me.

376
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,110
你要干什么
What are you gonna do?

377
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,730
你想明白我说的话
You want to understand what I'm talking about?

378
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,080
就跟我来
Follow my lead.

379
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,560
伙计  能帮我们解决一个赌局吗
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?

380
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,480
-我怎么  -抱歉
- I what? - Uh, sorry.

381
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,160
我并不想搞得像我在偷听
I don't want to make it sound like I was eavesdropping,

382
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,320
但我不小心听到了
but I kind of was.

383
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,180
我们听到你说股票的事
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.

384
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,400
那么问题来了
Yeah, so, question --

385
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,920
你能不能解决我和我妹妹的争论
if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.

386
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,380
算了吧  我们不该打扰这位...
Uh, you know what? We probably shouldn't be bothering this --

387
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,600
我们一般不麻烦别人  是吧
We wouldn't normally do this -- right?

388
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,870
但我们需要一个专家
But we need an expert.

389
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,920
他听起来好像很懂行
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.

390
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,040
没错  你说
Yeah, go.

391
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,950
行  问题是这样的
Okay. Here's the question.

392
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,950
在股票市场中
Uh, when it comes to the stock market,

393
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,740
允许个人投资的金额
is there, like, a financial limit

394
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,390
有没有限制
to how much a person's allowed to invest?

395
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,430
限制
A limit?

396
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,680
没  没限制
No. No limit.

397
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,410
我就知道  那如果是遗产呢
Knew it. Oh, even if it's an inheritance?

398
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,790
比如  要交遗产税之类的
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?

399
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,030
同样没有
Nope. Same.

400
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,630
太棒了  谢谢  伙计
That's -- oh, fantastic. Thank you, buddy.

401
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,810
听到没  没限制  跟你说了我们能全投进去
See? No limit. Told you we could invest it all.

402
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,590
而且这也是明智之举
And it's a smart move, too.

403
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,080
全存银行里  不行
Sticking it all in the bank? No.

404
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,710
没错  你可以投资所有的钱
Yeah. You can... invest all your money.

405
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,710
但确保要分散投资
Just make sure you diversify.

406
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,990
没错  分散投资
Yeah. Diversify.

407
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,200
那...  你得...
That's -- You got to --

408
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,300
你说的"分散投资"是什么意思
Oh, hey, um... what do you mean, "diversify"?

409
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,200
分散投资就是
Well, diversify is --

410
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,360
你听过一句名言
Y-you know that saying,

411
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,650
"鸡蛋别全放在一个篮子里"  是吧
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?

412
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,760
一个道理
Same principle.

413
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,030
没错  有道理  谢谢
No, it makes complete sense. Thank you.

414
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,460
如果你能告诉你要投多少钱
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about --

415
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,090
大致数目  我可以教你精明地分散投资
ballpark -- I could give you examples of smart diversification.

416
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,790
好吧...
Yeah, um...

417
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,090
听着  我们父亲那边的一位叔叔最近去世了
Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed,

418
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:05,180
给我们留下了大约一百四十万的遗产
and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.

419
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,330
不是我这人贪心  但我觉得
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think,

420
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,220
如果我们现在明智地投资
if we invest it smart now,

421
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,370
我们可以将它翻两倍  三倍
we could double it, triple it --

422
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,340
甚至可以将这笔钱翻四倍  对吗
we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?

423
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,920
在我看来
In my opinion?

424
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,470
财富属于有胆量的人  兄弟
Fortune favors the bold, man.

425
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,970
如果你们有时间和我喝一杯
Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,

426
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,380
我可以给你们简单参谋一下
I can give you a quick consult.

427
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,830
没关系  我们自己能行
That's all right. We were gonna do it ourselves

428
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,810
用那种在线经纪网站就行
through one of those online brokerage websites.

429
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,470
我们打算选个经典点的  比如...
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like --

430
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,110
好像是叫蓝筹股
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?

431
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,230
对  对  你们自己完全没问题
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.

432
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,830
就挑那些可靠的
Shoot for the tried and true.

433
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,010
当然  你们可能会把钱投到兴登堡号
'Course, you might be putting your cash in the Hindenburg,

434
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,010
德国大型飞艇  运营后第二年烧毁

435
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,220
意大利游轮  1956年与另一船只相撞沉没

436
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,220
安德烈亚·多里亚号
the Andrea Doria,

437
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,970
美国电影  上映后票房惨败

438
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,970
或者  《联邦大蠢探》上
uh..."Corky Romano."

439
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,280
不是吗
Right?

440
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,700
它们当时看起来都可靠极了  可结果呢
They all seemed rock-solid beforehand, but then...

441
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,670
是啊  不怎么好
Yeah, not good.

442
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,020
不怎么好  没错
Not good, yeah.

443
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,440
那要如何区分呢
So, how do you know?

444
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,900
那就需要我们这种人出场了
Well, that's where someone like myself comes in.

445
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,650
资深的理财经理
Proven track record as a wealth manager.

446
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,820
我能规避风险  又敢于冒险
I take calculated but aggressive risks

447
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,100
因为我想抓住转瞬即逝的机遇
'cause I want to catch lightning.

448
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,950
而我确实能
And I do.

449
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,090
我就是一台印钞机
Practically a money-printing machine.

450
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,780
听上去不错
That sounds good.

451
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,260
印钞机
A money-printing machine.

452
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,110
听着  那边有个小隔间
Listen, there's a little booth over here.

453
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,700
方便说话  我们可以谈谈  不用承诺什么
There's some privacy. We can talk. No obligations.

454
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,760
我们可以...  随便谈谈这件事
We can just -- just rap about this a little bit.

455
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,790
-好啊  也可以  -好吗
- Yeah, I guess. - Yeah?

456
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,280
你说呢  妹妹
What do you say, sis?

457
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,030
我们能谈谈吗
Can we just talk?

458
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,710
滑步舞啊
Electric slide on in there.

459
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,990
我们就简单谈两句  不是...
And we'll just rap a little bit. It's no --

460
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,540
顺便说一句  我叫肯
My name's Ken, by the way.

好啊  中间是"K"的维克多  
Cool. Viktor with a "K."

463
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,900
这位迷人的女士呢

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,160
我叫...吉赛尔  吉赛尔·圣·克莱尔
It's...Giselle. Giselle Saint Claire.

465
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,200
好名字
Ah, lovely.

466
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,630
请坐  我不会咬人的
Please, sit. I won't bite.

那么  中间是"K"的维克多和吉赛尔
So, Viktor with a "K" and Giselle

468
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,610
异域风情的名字
exotic names.

469
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,830
是荷兰人名
They're Dutch.

470
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,270
准确地说  是布尔人
Well, Boer, to be precise.

471
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,230
我们父亲家那边来自南非
Our...father's side of the family is from South Africa,

472
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,550
汉弗莱叔叔就是在那去世的

南非
South Africa.

474

那里盛产美女啊  不是吗
They grow them beautiful down there, right?

475
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,550
查理兹·塞隆  还有你
Charlize Theron. And you.

476
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,710
我其实没在那待过  不过希望以后能去
I've never actually been, but hope to go someday.

477
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,770
听着  等我为你们理财结束
Tell you what, by the time I'm done with you two,

478
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,460
你们可能连私人飞机都有了
you might be taking your own private jet.

479
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,530
好极了
Nice.

480
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,250
不好意思  我们都坐这儿了
Excuse me. Hi. Uh, we are sitting here now,

481
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,660
所以我们需要一份酒单  如果你...

482
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,570
你喜欢喝龙舌兰吗
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?

483
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,860
喜欢
Yes.

484

You down for that?

485
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,530
你喝过陈年蓝宝石吗
You ever try Zafira Añejo?

486
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,540
没喝过  不过我喝什么都行
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.

487
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,270
来三杯她说的那个
Three of whatever she just said.

488
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,720
-没问题  -好的
- You got it. - All right.

489
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,510
那么  股票市场  很棒的投资途径

490
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,330
现在正是入市的好时机
And you're picking the right time to jump in.

491
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,080
你为什么要听我的  我是个白痴
Why do you listen to me? I'm an idiot.

492
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,140
谈论他的豪车  谈论...
And talks about his cars, talks about --

493
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,620
-他有多少辆车  -我觉得...
- How many cars did he have? - I don't think --

494
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,800
-那没道理啊  -没错  肯
- It doesn't make sense. - That's it, Ken.

495
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,160
这是酒保送给你们的
Compliments of the bartender.

496
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,570
她觉得你们可能想留个纪念
She thought you might want a souvenir.

497
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,550
天啊  我们把整瓶酒喝光了吗
Oh, my God. Did we drink the entire bottle?

498
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,840
还没呢
Not yet, we didn't.

499
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,510

- Boom. - Hey, cheers.

500
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,960
我觉得我们该结账了
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.

501
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,660
不  这是最明智的方式
No, really, it's the smart way to go.

502
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,180
好吧  不过说清楚
Okay. But, so, to be clear,

503
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,820
你直接从我们的账户取钱来投资
you take the money directly from our account and invest it.

504
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,570

And then all the dividends and all the profits

00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,030
不
Oh, no.

538
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,990
我都没看清楚合同
I didn't read the fine print.

539
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,300
-等等  -爽
- Wait. - Yeah!

540
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,460
天呐
Holy crap.

541
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,940
真不敢相信...
I can't b--

542
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,590
你刷完能借我刷吗
Can I borrow that when you're done?

543
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,230
不行  太恶心了
No, that's gross.

544
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,440
怎么会恶心
H-how is it gross?

545
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,140
我们身上的病菌早就混到一起了
Our germs have already intermingled.

546
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,830
这是我的牙刷  情况不一样
It's my toothbrush. It's different.

547
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,790
怎么不一样了
Why is it different?

548
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,680
就是不一样
Because.

549
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,710
牙龈经常出血  就会有...
You know, gums bleed, and there's --

550
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,300
会有唇疱疹病菌  各种食物以及古怪的...
there's cold sores, all sorts of food and weir--

551
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:07,880
让我看看  来嘛
Let me see that. Come on.

552
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,300
什么  不
What? No!

553
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,670
来嘛  我现在就刷
Come on! I'll do it right now.

554
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,410
-我才不管  -我得刷牙了
- I don't care. - I need to brush my teeth.

555
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,800
我没其它牙刷了  怨不得我
I don't have an extra. It's not my problem.

556
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,150
没关系  我用这个
That's fine. I got this.

557
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,860
很好  这样我不介意
Good. I'm fine with this.

558
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,750
我也不介意
Yeah, me too.

559
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,760
看我等会儿用什么当牙线
Wait till you see what I floss with.

560
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,390
该好好留着这个
That's a keeper.

561
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:52,340
谢啦  中间是"K"的维克多
Thank you, Viktor with a "K."

562
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,500
如果我们每晚都那样  不是很好吗
Wouldn't it be great if we could do that every night?

563
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,290
是啊  是很好
Yes, it would.

564
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,780
可惜...
But...

565
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,450
我们不能那样
we can't.

566
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,560
我知道
I know, yeah.

567
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,280
只是说说嘛  如果可以  一定会很棒
But I'm just saying, if we could, it would be great.

568
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,870
但我知道我们不能
But I know we can't.

569
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,250
糟了  今天我不能迟到
Oh, crap. I can't be late today.

570
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,100
霍华德要分配任务
Howard is doling out assignments,

571
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,980
最后进门的人
and the last one through the door

572
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,600
只能去复审文件
could get stuck in doc review.

573
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,470
你要出去吗
You got somewhere to go?

574
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,450
是啊  我要去一个地方
Yeah. Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.

575
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,110
好了吗
You good?

576
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,870
好了
Yeah. All good.

577
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,730
你是丹尼尔·沃莫尔德吗
Daniel Wormald?

578
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,830
我是贝克警官  这位是萨克斯顿警官
I'm Officer Baker. This is Officer Saxton.

579
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,540
好的  请进吧
Yeah, please. Come on in.

580
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,480
进来吧  在这里
Come in. It's over here.

581
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,470
看看他们做了什么
See what they did?

582
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,080
全都被盗走了
I mean, all gone.

583
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,730
一个不剩啊  就...
All of them, just --

584
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,960
什么一个不剩
Uh, what's all gone?

585
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,460
我有  我之前有一套棒球卡片的珍藏
I have -- I had a baseball-card collection --

586
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,040
一整套呢...全被盗走了
a major collection -- all stolen.

587
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,240
很遗憾听到这消息
Oh, sorry to hear that.

588
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,020
有很多人知道你收集棒球卡吗
Uh, was it common knowledge that you have baseball cards?

589
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,700
不  也不算多
No, not really.

590
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,610
所以  没什么人格外觊觎你的卡片
So, nobody in particular you can think of wanting them?

591
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,380
没有  我想不出来  没有
No. Not that I -- No.

592
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,720
他们怎么进来的
How'd they get in?

593
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,060
那边的后门
Uh, the back door over here.

594
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,840
我回家吃午饭的时候发现它开着
It was open when I came home for lunch.

595
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,180
本来是锁上的
I mean, it was locked,

596
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,180
他们肯定是撬了锁还怎么的
but they must have jimmied it open or something.

597
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,810
你觉得大概是什么时候的事
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?

598
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,990
我8点15分去上班  12点半回家吃午饭
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30,

599
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,340
然后立马就报警了
and called you immediately.

600
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,730
有没有丢失其他物品
Was anything else taken?

601
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,210
现金  不少现金
Cash -- a fair bit. Uh, um...

602
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,260
有多少
How much cash?

603
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,100
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

604
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,120
先关注最重要的东西好吗
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?

605
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,710
我只关心我的棒球卡
All I really care about are my baseball cards.

606
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,430
我有一张托普斯家的米奇·曼托新秀卡
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card

607
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,110
那是独一无二的
that's irreplaceable.

608
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,200
铸币级的
It's a mint,

609
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,120
定位比例正面为60/40  反面为90/10
60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.

610
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,200
我可以列举出很多特色
I can go on.

611
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,890
我所有的卡片都是小心存储的
All my cards are in top-loaders,

612
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,970
如果把它们拿出来风吹日晒的
but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,

613
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,500
或者是弯折了  天呐可千万别
I mean, or creased, God forbid,

614
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,190
短短几秒钟  就会贬值一大截
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.

615
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,020
我知道像这样的案子
I understand the first 48 hours

616
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,820
案发后四十八小时是破案的黄金时期
are the most important in investigations like this,

617
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,640
时间过去越久
so the more time passes,

618
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,280
找到失物的可能性就越小
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.

619
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,880
所以  时间宝贵啊  兄弟们
So...time is of the essence here, guys.

620
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,760
我们会尽全力帮助你的  沃莫尔德先生
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.

621
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,770
很好
Good.

622
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,440
他们还真是把这地方翻了个底朝天
They really tossed this place.

623
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,130
你确定他们不是在找其他东西吗
I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?

624
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,360
比如说
Like what?

625
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,140
我不知道  只是问问你的想法
I don't know. J-Just wondering your thoughts.

626
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,460
我猜他们想找更多棒球卡吧
I assume more baseball cards.

627
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,670
除了锁在那个盒子里的
Did you have more baseball cards

628
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,110
你还有其他棒球卡吗
than the ones you keep locked in that case here?

629
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,890
有  在后面  好几千张呢
Yes, in -- in back -- thousands.

630
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,250
但是这些才是极品
But these were the crown jewels over here.

631
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,130
全明星阵容
You know, t-the all-star lineup.

632
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,610
好吧
Right.

633
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,840
怎么了
What?

634
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,300
我只是想理清一下状况
Just trying to make sense of it.

635
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,570
有什么好理的
What's to make sense of?

636
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,400
不就是小偷来偷棒球卡吗  多简单
I mean, isn't it as simple as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?

637
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,780
或者是嗑药嗑嗨了
Or hopped up on speed or whatever

638
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,350
疯了一样来这扫荡一通
and went nuts with the vandalism?

639
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,080
是啊  也有可能
Yeah. I mean, that could be.

640
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,700
外面那辆悍马挺酷的
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.

641
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,970
是你的吗
That yours?

642
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,600
对  是我的
Yeah, that's mine.

643
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,230
租来的
Uh, it's a lease.

644
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,690
价钱特别划算
Got a great deal on it.

645
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,110
真酷
It's very sweet.

646
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,040
你知道吗  他们说悍马
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger

647
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
就是为了阿诺德·斯瓦辛格而生的
is the reason that Hummers exist.

648
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,370
我也不知道为什么  他们就这么说的
I don't know how, but that's what they say.

649
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,570
真的啊
No kidding.

650
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,890
你是做什么工作的  沃莫尔德先生
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?

651
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,510
我是搞IT的
Uh, I work I.T.,

652
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,750
在一家制药公司上班
uh, for a pharmaceutical company.

653
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,150
哇  捣鼓电脑的
Wow. Computers.

654
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,180
天哪  我就该学计算机的
God, I should've gotten into computers.

655
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,370
-那我也能开那样的悍马了  -没错
- I'd have that same Hummer. - Yeah, right.

656
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,680
兄弟们  我很高兴你们喜欢我的车
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car,

657
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,510
但我觉得我们现在
but I think we're looking through

658
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,630
重点错了吧
the wrong end of the telescope here.

659
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,020
最重要的是要找到我的棒球卡
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.

660
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,100
当然
Of course.

661
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,880
好的  我把我的所有藏品列了一份详细清单
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection

662
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,370
高价的卡片旁边标了星号
and asterisks next to the high-ticket items,

663
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,080
所以很容易就能看出来他们会最先出手哪些
so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first,

664
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,140
因为这些超级超级值钱
'cause they're super, super valuable.

665
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,600
你们需要拿着这份清单去找典当行
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops,

666
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,800
收藏爱好者  查问所有
uh, collectors, question anyone who's done

667
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,840
有类似前科的人
any sort of crime like this in the past.

668
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,310
那些按常理来说有嫌疑的人
You know, the -- the usual suspects.

669
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,490
我能把名单给你们  好让你们开始调查吗
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?

670
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,330
好的  那样再好不过了
Yeah, you -- Yeah, if you could get us that list...

671
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,910
我会...我会打印出来的
Okay, I'll -- I'll print it out.

汉克·阿伦卡  铸币级

676
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,460
继续深呼吸
Keep breathing.

677
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,090

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,380
没拿走电视机
Left the TV.

679
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,870
-没拿走电脑  -没错
- Left the computer. - Right.

680
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,580
眼前这情况看上去有点不对劲
There's something wrong with this picture.

681
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,960
喂  是我
Hey, it's me.

682
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,990
我又在这个天堂度过了完美的一天
Another perfect day in paradise out here.

683
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,580
我在泳池里
I'm in the pool.

684
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,120
给我回电
Okay, call me.

685
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,900
-你好吗  -宝贝  吃过中饭了吗
- How are you? - Hey, babe. Did you get lunch?

686
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,950
我吃了
I did.

687
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,970
我觉得我背上快被晒焦了
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.

688
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,070
真的吗  你可真走运
Oh, really? Well, you're just in luck.

689
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,170
-瞧瞧我拿了什么  -太好了
- Look what I have. - Oh, hey, great.

690
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,070
你这里都被晒红了
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here. Yeah.

691
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,930
好爽啊  宝贝
That feels good, babe.

692
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,620
我跟你说了不要在太阳下待太久
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.

693
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,720
你就是不听
You don't listen.

694
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,310
喂  又是我
Yeah, it's me again.

695
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,680
我说话这当儿  离我不到八米的地方
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,

696
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,780
我正看着目标
I'm looking at the mark.

697
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,650
喜剧《盖里尔的岛》中的大富翁

698
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,650
想象下豪威尔·瑟斯顿三世和金吉同居后的样子
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.

699
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,380
他浑身上下都是古驰牌的
He's dripping in Gucci.

700
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,450
就好像  我蹲在水坑里
It's like I'm at the watering hole,

701
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,670
我是准备出击的母狮  看着那头
and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo

702
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,900
最肥最迟缓的水牛向我露出了脖子
expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.

703
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,260

加入我吧  加入狮群吧
Join me. Join the pride.

705
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,710
我刚说母狮
Um, I said "Lioness"

706
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,980
是因为狩猎是母狮的活儿
because it's the females who do all the hunting.

707
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,730
只是想准确描述这个物种
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate,

708
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,210
跟我的性别无关
irrespective of my own sex.

随时都能换
it's not a big deal to change it out.

722
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,580
听上去真是...
That sounds really, uh...

723
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,780
太好了

724
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,470

如果这不符合您的品味
If this isn't to your taste,
