61
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,050
住户就会让吉米出马

Come on.

176
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,600
第二已经非常棒了
Second is still very, very good.

177
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:03,510
好吧
All right.

178
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,750
谢谢
Thanks.

179
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,480
今晚见吗
See you tonight?

180
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,390
再说
Maybe.

181
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,690
如果你表现好的话
If you play your cards right.

182
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,600
你好啊美女
Hello, beautiful.

183
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,770
女士们  喜欢吗
What do you think, ladies?

184
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,910
我知道  很棒吧
Yeah, I know, right?

185
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,240
内部全真皮
It's got all leather interior,

186
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,980
加热座椅适合沙漠地区寒冷的早晨
heated seats for those cold desert mornings.

187
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,040
这绝对是天堂的样子
This must be what heaven looks like.

188
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,840
来个告别拥抱吧
Goodbye hug?

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,840
不来吗
No?

190
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,190
好吧  那就擦干泪水
All right, well, forgo the tears

191
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,720
轻轻说一句  后会有期
and just say, "Till we meet again."

192
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,560
大概是公制尺寸的吧
Must be metric.

193
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,270
沃尔多峡谷路
拉谢内加
圣达菲

194
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,140
你在这干什么
What -- what are you doing here?

195
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,150
我在这儿工作
I work here.

196
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,520
真巧啊
Small world.

197
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,270
那这里是警局的停车场吗
So, is this the parking lot for the police station?

198
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,610
是的
It is.

199
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,880
你不知道他们能不能让我进  对吧
You don't know if they validate, do you?

200
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,300
不如你在那边停车吧
Why don't you pull around over there,

201
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,430
我们谈几句
and we'll have a little talk.

202
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,630
好吧
Uh, okay.

203
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,950
你来这干什么
Why are you here?

204
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,530
我有事找警察
I-I have business with the police.

205
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,910
是什么事呢
And what business might that be?

206
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,580
如果你非要知道的话  我被抢劫了
Well, if you must know, I was robbed.

207
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,600
有人闯进我家  偷走了我的财产
Somebody broke into my house and stole my property.

208
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,950
你的毒品吧
Your drugs.

209
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,660
是的  但显然我没对警察说
Yeah, but obviously I didn't tell the cops that.

210
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,020
我又不蠢
I'm not stupid.

211
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,740
你已经和他们说过情况了吗
You've already spoken to them?

212
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,400
两个警察来过我家
A couple of them came by my house.

213
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,840
但我在意的不是毒品
But it's not the drugs that I care about.

214
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,300
不  我在意
I mean, I care.

215
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,130
但我更想讨回我的棒球卡片
It's my baseball cards I need back.

216
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,320
-你的棒球卡片  -是的
- Your baseball cards? ‭- Yes.

217
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,550
我有一套非常珍贵的棒球卡片集
I have a very valuable collection of baseball cards,

218
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,980
被人偷走了
and someone stole them.

219
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,980
我就知道还得我来跟你说
I guess I shouldn't be surprised I have to tell you this.

220
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,910
你已经是个罪犯了  还主动找警察谈话
But it's probably a bad idea that you willingly talk to the police,

221
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,230
这大概不是个好主意
being a criminal and all.

222
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,410
我又不是以罪犯的身份来的
I'm not here as a criminal.

223
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,870
我是受害者
I'm here as a crime victim.

224
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,840
我只是偶尔卖卖药品
Just because I occasionally sell some pharmaceuticals,

225
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,320
就要失去受法律保护的权利吗
I no longer have a right to protection from crime?

226
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,200
而且我和他们谈的时候非常谨慎
And I was very careful when I talked to them.

227
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,580
他们不知道我卖药
I -- they have no idea about my other business.

228
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,390
既然你已经报告过情况了  为什么还要来
If you already made your report, why are you here?

229
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,480
他们喊我来的
They called me.

230
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,990
说还有几个问题要问
They have a few more questions.

231
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,420
他们很努力地在寻找小偷
They are very dedicated to finding this thief.

232
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,520
既然你还是个新手  我来给你解释一下
Since you're new to this, let me explain it to you.

233
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,100
他们在钓鱼
They've invited you on a fishing trip.

234
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,070
什么意思  钓鱼
What's that? A fishing trip?

235
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,640
那些警察对讨回你的卡片根本没兴趣
Those cops have no interest in helping you get your cards back.

236
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,880
他们显然怀疑你
You're obviously under suspicion.

237
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,190
他们什么也没看到啊
There was nothing there for them to see.

238
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,870
你想想我们之前的谈话
I refer you ‭to our previous conversation

239
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,960
再看看这个如霓虹灯般闪闪发光的
and this blinking neon sign of a vehicle

240
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,040
写满"毒贩子"三个字的车
that says "Drug dealer."

241
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,380
他们怀疑你
They suspect you.

242
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,290
他们会让你进去  装作是你的朋友
They will get you in there, pretend to be your friend,

243
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,100
给你一种虚假的安全感
lull you into a false sense of security,

244
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,240
然后他们会让你心虚
and then they will sweat you.

245
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,580
你就会露出破绽
and you will break.

246
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,280
我不  我
I don't -- I --

247
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,380
我不同意
I disagree.

248
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,000
没有商量的余地  你现在就回家
Not open for debate. You go home now.

249
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,620
但是我和他们约好了啊
But I have an appointment.

250
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,650
爽约
Break it.

251
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,030
如果他们打电话给你  别接
And if they call you, do not answer the phone.

252
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,850
那我的棒球卡片怎么办
But what about my baseball cards?

253
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,270
那是你生意的代价
Cost of doing business.

254
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,590
不行  不不不
No! No, no, no!

255
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,310
我得讨回来
I am getting those back!

256
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,190
我愿意冒险
I will take the risk!

257
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,390
不  你不能冒险
No, you won't.

258
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,700
因为你会把我也置于险境
Because then you'll be putting my well-being at risk.

259
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,350
我只能这样
I have to!

260
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,680
我  我
I-I --

261
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,930
那些卡片啊
Those cards?

262
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,310
有一部分是我爸留给我的
Some of them were my dad's.

263
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,590
我要讨回来
I-I am getting them back.

264
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,460
我必须讨回来
I'm getting them back.

265
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,620
我会找到你的卡片的
I'll find your cards.

266
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,950
先生  你
Is -- sir--

267
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,530
你也能做这个吗
Is that something you do?

268
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,230
那真是
Wow, that's...

269
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,690
那你真是太好了
That is so generous of you.

270
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,790
你要付我钱的
Oh, it'll cost you.

271
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,770
好吧
Okay, uh...

272
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,740
我们可以讨论下财务问题
We should discuss some sort of financial arrangement

273
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,630
我可以...
in which I-I, uh...

274
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,350
那好吧
Okay, then!

275
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,490
老天
Jesus.

276
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,330
戴维斯梅因律所
律师

277
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,660
保证金

278
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,690
矶鹞渡生活协助中心

279
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,770
请进
Come on in.

280
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,690
我不是故意打断你的
I didn't mean to interrupt.

281
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,940
没关系  我只是弹琴放松一下
Not at all. I was just blowing off some steam.

282
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,660
-弹得挺不错  -谢谢
- You sound good. - ‭Thank you.

283
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,760
有助于保持头脑清醒  你会弹吗
Clears the head. You play?

284
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,560
上高中时学过一阵
Oh, I tried to learn in high school,

285
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,230
但后来我决定用更简单的方法追女孩
but then I decided there were easier ways to get girls.

286
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,410
我希望你有减压的方法
well, I hope you've got a way to decompress.

287
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,800
人人都需要减压
Everybody needs something.

288
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,470
你在这适应得怎么样
How you settling in?

289
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,320
挺好的
Great.

290
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,380
对我来说是向前迈了一大步
Uh, it's -- ‭it's quite a step up for me.

291
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,790
我们很高兴有你加入
Well, we're happy to have you.

292
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,400
有其他需要随时告诉我们  吉米
Just let us know if there's anything else you need, Jimmy.

293
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,550
谢谢  克利福德
Thanks...Cliff.

294
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,170
我也很高兴能加入这里
Um, I'm happy to be here.

295
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,560
很好
Great.

296
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,790
我该回去工作了
Uh, better get back to it.

297
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,560
好的  我也该工作了
Yeah, me, too, I suppose.

298
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,390
其实  我在首次信息披露中发现了点东西
Actually, um, ‭I might have found something in the initial disclosures.

299
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,900
-是吗  -斯韦卡特和考科利不断提到
- Oh, yeah? - Schweikart and Cokely keep referring to

300
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,230
这是一个"可选的津贴项目"
the "Optional Allowance Program,"

301
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,990
但是我查了很多住户的合同
but I checked a number of residents' contracts.

302
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,750
所有合同都选择了这个津贴计划
Not a single one has opted out, which makes me think

303
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,610
我认为这更像是一个强制性的财务安排
it's more of a mandatory financial arrangement.

304
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,420
你认为这就是他们在提交的材料中所指的
And you're thinking that's the "Failure to state a claim"

305
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,960
"起诉理由不足"吗
that they filed in their answer?

306
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,400
他们不断强调这是可选计划  是自愿的
They keep saying it's optional, thereby voluntary.

307
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,010
我们可以反驳他们
I think we can counter that

308
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,340
如果入住的前提条件是必须"选择加入"
if "Opting in" is a requirement for residency,

309
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,840
事实也是如此
which it sure seems to be,

310
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,570
那他们声称的"自愿"就站不住脚了
well, their voluntary claims don't hold water.

311
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,700
你这个发现可能意义重大
Might be on to something here.

312
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,170
干得漂亮  吉米
Nice work, Jimmy.

313
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,920
谢谢  克利福德
Thanks, Cliff.

314
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,750
你好
Hola.

315
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,950
你好啊
Hola. Cómo estás?

316
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,040
欢迎光临  有什么能为您效劳的
Welcome. How can I help you?

317
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,530
我想打听下价钱
Um, I was hoping to get an estimate.

318
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,490
是我的车
Uh, mi car. Mi coche.

319
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,750
你们可以干车子的活吧
You do cars?

320
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,610
当然可以  没问题
Sí. Cars. Todo el tiempo.

321
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,340
我想把坐椅的椅面换一下
I-I was hoping ‭to get my seats reupholstered.

322
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,950
跟我出去看一下好吗
Um, take a look? Mira?

323
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,040
-稍等一下  -好的
- Un momento. - ‭Sí, sí, sí, sí.

324
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
谢谢
Gracias.

325
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,680
就是这辆
Yeah.

326
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,140
换点新鲜东西
Thinking something new.

327
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,920
给这个老家伙一点宠爱
Give the old girl a little love.

328
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,590
我很高兴干这个活儿
但是有这些钱还不如买辆新车

329
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,190
他说你还是留着钱买辆新车比较划算
He said you should save your money and get a new car.

330
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,520
是吗  但是我对这辆车有特殊的感情
Yeah? Well, it has a sentimental value.

331
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,420
古董车
Classic car.

332
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,770
他想要什么样的

333
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,340
椅面想用什么材料
What material do you want?

334
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,010
当然是皮的
Well, I was thinking leather, definitely.

335
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,020
鳄鱼皮就不错
Maybe alligator.

336
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,160
那要花好多钱呢
Señor. Too much money.

337
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,760
是  但我说了  我对这车有感情
Yeah, but like I said, it has a sentimental value.

338
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,050
我觉得奇奇怪怪的皮革跟这车不太配

339
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,050
换点跟车的风格更搭的材料比较好

340
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,140
说服他

341
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,550
他说鳄鱼皮跟这辆车不搭
He says, uh, alligator's gonna look all wrong.

342
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,900
便宜点的材料更好
Cheaper might be better.

343
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,050
给我看看你选的
Well, show me what you'd pick.

344
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,500
抱歉  先生
I'm sorry, señor.

345
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,980
我儿子  让他来帮你  行吗
My son -- ‭he -- he will help you, okay?

346
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,950
帮他选个材料

347
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,870
别给他推销贵的了

348
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,860
见到你很高兴
Mucho gusto.

349
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,180
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

350
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,340
你找我干什么
Why are you here?

351
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,830
棒球卡
Baseball cards.

352
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,840
我猜  你看到那个开豪车的中年危机男
The way I figure, you saw that mid-life crisis of a vehicle

353
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,960
就明智地决定不和他做生意了
and wisely decided ‭to cut ties with the man,

354
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,820
这我不怪你  因为我也不和他做了
and I don't blame you -- I did, too.

355
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,260
但是你劫了他家
And then you ripped him off.

356
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,420
我相信顺走那些棒球卡
And I'm sure those baseball cards

357
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,490
还能从那个蠢货身上额外捞一笔
looked like an easy way to make a few extra bucks

358
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,050
顺便还能给他上一课
off that idiot, teach him a lesson, too.

359
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,930
但是你低估了
But you underestimated

360
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,630
这个人有多么白痴
just how big an idiot you were dealing with.

361
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,650
不  我很清楚
No, I am pretty aware.

362
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,800
好吧  那么你低估了
Well, then, you underestimated

363
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,930
这个人对这些棒球卡片的感情有多深
how attached the man was to those cards --

364
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,190
深到他打给警察报失
so attached he called the police and reported them stolen.

365
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,740
现在警察在到处查
Now they're nosing around.

366
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,780
这好像是你的问题
That sounds like a "you" problem.

367
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,600
不  我觉得更像是我们的问题
No, I think it's very much an "us" problem.

368
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,570
我想我还是碰碰运气吧
Yeah, I guess I'll just have to take my chances.

369
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,720
不过祝你好运
But good luck to you.

370
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,620
我还希望你能看到我们的困境
You know, I was hoping you'd see our dilemma

371
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,970
做出正确的选择
and do the right thing.

372
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,470
但我想现在是一个软硬兼施的情况
But I think what we have here now is a carrot-and-stick situation.

373
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,770
是吗
Oh, yeah?

374
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
这是要来硬的吗
This is the stick? Hmm?

375
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,880
你来威胁我的家人吗
You coming here, threatening my family?

376
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,420
你得再强硬些  老东西
'Cause you're gonna need a bigger stick, old man.

377
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,490
我不是要威胁你的家人
I'm not here to threaten your family.

378
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,480
真正的狠角色是屠库·塞拉曼加
And the name of the stick is Tuco Salamanca.

379
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,960
如果你不照我说的做  恕我直言
Now, you don't play ball, so to speak,

380
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,050
屠库要是发现了你的第二职业
and Tuco finds out about your little side business.

381
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,050
这够硬了吗
That a big enough stick?

382
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,390
不过  我还是更喜欢软的
However, I prefer the carrot.

383
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,700
我觉得你也会喜欢
I think you will, too.

384
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,200
那要怎么做
And what would that be?

385
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,320
你把棒球卡片还给我
You give me back the baseball cards,

386
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,590
还有一万美金现钞
$10,000 in cash,

387
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,040
你还可以净赚大约
and you net roughly --

388
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,720
大约六万美金
roughly -- $60,000.

389
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,960
那该怎么做
And how exactly does that work?

390
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,730
欧内斯托
Ernesto.

391
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,920
要出门吗
Going somewhere?

392
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,540
是的
Yes, we are.

393
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,280
转弯的时候需要些技巧
She's a little tricky around the corners.

394
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,150
而且  得加高级汽油
So... and you got to go with the premium gas.

395
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,170
我知道这好像是骗人的  但还是有很大不同
I know it seems like a scam, but it makes a huge difference.

396
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,870
我会一周洗一次车
And I would get her washed at least once a week.

397
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,820
还要手工打蜡
And spring for the hand wax.

398
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,590
这透明涂层需要多一层保护
You're gonna want that extra layer of protection for the clear coat.

399
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,560
这车值得最好的保护
She deserves the best.

400
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,410
我会确保拆车厂的伙计们
I'll make sure the boys at the chop shop

401
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,740
对她温柔一些的
are real gentle with her.

402
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,580
等等  为什么要拆
Wait. W-why?

403
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,870
不
No.

404
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,720
你觉得我会开那辆车吗
You think I'd be caught dead driving that thing?

405
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,510
那就跟六岁皮条客的校车一样
It looks like a school bus for 6-year-old pimps.

406
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,700
好了  我们能继续了吗
All right, shall we move this along?

407
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,410
阿伦
Aaron.

408
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,200
好  这是基特那张
Okay, there's Jeter.

409
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,010
好的  好的
All right. Okay.

410
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,730
曼托  曼托  这是曼托那张
Mantle. Mantle. There's Mantle.

411
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,670
完事了吗
‭We good?

412
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,770
是的  好像都在这儿
Uh, yeah, that looks like everyone.

413
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,570
都在  都在这儿了
Yeah, they're here. ‭Looks like everyone's here.

414
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:48,690
另外一样
And now the other item.

415
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,370
现在我们的交易正式结束
And now our business is concluded.

416
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,010
我一直在想是不是该向你道歉
You know, I can't help thinking an apology was in order.

417
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,130
又是警察打来的
Uh, it's -- it's the police again.

418
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,150
矶鹞渡并没有真正回应我们的披露请求
Sandpiper hasn't really responded to our discovery requests.

419
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,380
他们让我们做了大量文书工作
They've buried us in paperwork,

420
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,400
但没有任何东西跟这个案子的详情有关
but nothing actually relevant to the particulars in this case.

421
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,850
意料之中
No real surprise there.

422
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,820
我们也许该要求他们出示银行记录
We may have to subpoena their bank records.

423
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,990
谢谢  艾琳  吉米
Thank you, Erin. Jimmy.

424
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,800
客户那儿处理的怎么样了
How we doing with client outreach?

425
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,170
我们在等那些传票的同时
Oh, while we're waiting on those subpoenas,

426
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,450
还应该尝试从客户那里
I'm thinking we should try wrangling some of this stuff

427
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,950
获取文件
from the clients themselves.

428
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,630
他们中大部分人都会保留复印文本
Most of these folks have hard copies of everything

429
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,530
可追溯到埃森豪威尔时代
going back to ‭the Eisenhower administration.

430
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,680
当然  考虑到他们的...
Of course, given some of their, uh...

431
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,420
不一致的组织方式
inconsistent organizational practices,

432
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,990
进展会很缓慢
it's gonna be slow going.

433
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,610
抱歉打断一下
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

434
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:49,620
有一位女士  人很好
Uh, this one lady, um, she's sweet,

435
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,910
但是完全听不见
but, uh, deaf as a doornail.

436
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,680
她把所有的文件都放在  放在
She keeps all of her paperwork in, um, she keeps it --

437
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,120
对不起  抱歉  吉米
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jimmy.

438
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,520
我需要所有人的手机
I'm gonna need everybody's phone,

439
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,220
钥匙  还有电子设备
key fobs, and electronics.

440
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
查克  欢迎
Chuck. Welcome.

441
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,890
请坐
Please. Have a seat.

442
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,900
不要在意我
Don't mind me.

443
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,990
大家好
Hey, everybody.

444
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,020
抱歉打扰了
Sorry for the interruption.

445
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,440
就当我不在这儿
Just pretend I'm not here.

446
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,040
很高兴你能来
Happy to have you.

447
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,050
吉米  我们说到哪儿了
Jimmy, where were we?

448
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,260
对
Uh, yeah.

449
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,700
我正说到...
So, I was saying...

450
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,220
从部分委托人那获取文件
getting the documents from some of the clients...

451
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,560
他们中的有些人显然是囤物狂
We definitely have some pack rats.

452
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,670
祝他们好运
God bless 'em.

453
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,990
我那天去拜访圣达菲矶鹞渡的古斯多夫女士
I was visiting Mrs. Gusdorff at, uh, Sandpiper Santa Fe,

454
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,380
那天下午我都在整理大卖场发放的
and I spent the whole afternoon sorting through just a haystack

455
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,730
成堆的菜谱和半价优惠券
of recipes and half-off coupons from Big Lots.

456
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,750
但整理的成果是这位女士
But now we've got copies of this woman's monthly statements

457
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,300
从1997年3月起的月账单
going back to march 1997,

458
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,920
因此  尽管这样有些耗费人力
so it might be a little labor-intensive,

459
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,200
但委托人永远是我们最好的资源
but our clients will always be our best resource.

460
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:47,640
此外  他们那还有糖吃
Plus, they have ribbon candy.

461
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,290
吉米
Jimmy.

462
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,540
你好
Hello?

463
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,690
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

464
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,900
我名字就刻在这座楼上
‭My name is on the building.

465
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,300
很高兴你能回来
So great to have you here.

466
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,360
如果你需要什么  我就在办公室
If you need anything, I'll be in my office.

467
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,080
你来干什么
Why are you here?

468
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,710
来亲眼见证
To bear witness.

469
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,710
詹姆斯·麦吉尔
James Mcgill.

470
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,470
我是厄门绍特
It's Ehrmantraut.

471
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:49,140
你的道德观念还够灵活吗
You still morally flexible?

472
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,740
如果是  我有个活儿给你
If so, I might have a job for you.

473
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,400
何时何地
Where and when?

474
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,830
请坐
Take a seat.

475
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,570
沃莫尔德先生  感谢你能前来配合调查
Mr. Wormald, thank you for coming in and talking to us.

476
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,700
应该的
Yeah, of course.

477
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,160
我们看了警官在现场
Yeah, we've been looking at the reports

478
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,900
所写的报告
that the officers took at the scene,

479
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,250
我们有几个后续的小问题
and we have a few ‭small follow-up questions.

480
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,090
抱歉浪费你的时间  只是常规流程
Sorry to waste your time. Just standard stuff.

481
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,170
没必要带律师过来
There's really no need for a lawyer to be here.

482
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:26,930
我其实是来当他的顾问
I'm here in more of an advisory capacity.

483
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,110
丹只是想有个友善的人在他身边
Dan just, uh, wanted a friendly face next to him.

484
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,920
我们都很友善啊
‭Well, we're all friendly here.

485
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,140
看看我们  四个朋友
Look at us. Four friends.

486
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,230
我们只是想理清事实
We just want to get the facts straight

487
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,360
以便找回你的财物
so we can, um, help you get your property for you.

488
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,250
其实...没关系的
Yeah, you know, uh, it's fine.

489
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,350
用不着...
Uh, yeah, there's no need to, uh --

490
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,260
不  这只是常规程序
No, it's just standard procedure.

491
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,630
你知道  警官有时
You know, ‭officers don't always get

492
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,930
也无法把所有的所需信息写进报告里
all the information we need in their report.

493
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,110
我们只是想抓住偷了你的棒球卡的人
We just want to find the guys who took your baseball cards.

494
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,120
是啊  那...
Yeah, that's, uh...

495
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,100
我叔叔有一张泰·柯布的烟草卡
You know, my uncle ‭had a Ty Cobb tobacco card.

496
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,370
他把那玩意存放在十五厘米厚的玻璃底下
Kept that thing behind six inches of glass

497
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,360
好像是幅名画一样
like it was the Mona Lisa or something.

498
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,860
泰·柯布
Wow. Ty Cobb?

499
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,750
告诉他把光线调暗
Tell him to keep the lights low.

500
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,330
就算是人工照明也会释放一定量的
Even artificial lighting has a certain amount

501
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,040
紫外辐射  那可能会...
of ultraviolet radiation that can, uh, you know...

502
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,990
长远来看...
over the long term --

503
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,120
你能告诉我们
Um, can you just remind us

504
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,220
你在屋子里存放卡片的准确位置吗
exactly where you kept your cards in the house?

505
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:27,050
好的  正如我想说的  那不再是问题了
Yeah, well, uh, as I was trying to say, it's no longer an issue.

506
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,510
我找到它们了
I found them.

507
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,560
你找到卡片了
So you found the cards?

508
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,690
是的
Uh, yep.

509
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:37,690
我就是想亲自过来  告诉你们
I just wanted to come down and tell you, you know, in person.

510
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,810
你找到了
You found them?

511
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,630
在哪  房子周围吗
Where? Around the house?

512
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,790
不是  我雇了私家侦探
No. I, uh, I hired a private investigator,

513
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,750
他找到了卡片
and he tracked them down.

514
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,020
是的
So, yeah.

515
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,150
真的吗  哪儿找到的
Really? So, where were they?

516
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,370
没关系了  真的
You know, it's fine. It is.

517
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,810
我真的...我不能再打扰你们了
I really -- I ought to get out of your hair.

518
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,550
你们在我身上浪费的时间够多了
You've wasted enough time on me.

519
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,550
不  不  没关系  这是我们的工作
No, no, it's -- ‭it's okay. It's our job.

520
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,420
我们只是想弄清真相
We just want to get the facts right

521
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,060
以便帮你结案
so we can help close this case for you.

522
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,250
已经搞定了
It's done.

523
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,820
案子结了
Case closed!

524
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,880
我知道你们有多...
I just -- I know how much, you know,

525
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,640
你们有多少案子需要处理
you guys have on your hands,

526
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,480
杀人犯  抢劫犯  黑帮什么的
like murderers and robbers and gangs and stuff. I --

527
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,680
丹尼  你要不要出去透会气
Hey, Danny, ‭why don't you get some air?

528
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,650
你去喝点咖啡
You can have some coffee.

529
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,770
我来和警探们说清楚
I'll finish up ‭with the detectives here.

530
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,060
好了  伙计们  我们直说吧
Okay, let's get down to brass tacks here, guys.

531
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,510
我猜你们两位制服整齐的警官
I'm guessing your two fine uniformed officers

532
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,610
发现了沃莫尔德先生藏东西的据点
found Mr. Wormald's little hidey hole,

533
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,470
所以你们才如此热心地
and that's why you two are so interested

534
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,370
"帮助"我这位朋友
in "Helping" my friend here.

535
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,340
我明白
I get it.

536
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,100
在踢脚线背后发现藏匿地点
A hiding place in the baseboard --

537
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,530
任何人都会起疑心的
it's gonna make anyone suspicious.

538
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,690
但我保证没有违法的事
But let me assure you there's nothing illegal going on here.

539
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,580
那他为什么这么紧张
Then why is he so nervous?

540
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,150
因为要我说  流汗就值得怀疑
'cause I must say, the flop sweat is kind of suspect.

541
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,110
我们都有秘密  不是吗
We all have our secrets, don't we?

542
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,110
又有谁是一尘不染的呢
And who among us is without sin?

543
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,980
但那些罪过不全是犯罪
But those sins aren't all of the criminal variety,

544
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,130
沃莫尔德先生也没有犯罪
and neither are Mr. Wormald's, okay?

545
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,300
但那是很私密的东西
They are, however, very private.

546
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,510
私密  比如贩毒吗
Private, like drug dealer, maybe?

547
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,970
不  当然不是
No, no!

548
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,730
他一直回避  因为那是个敏感话题
He's being evasive because it's a sensitive subject,

549
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,820
需要小心处理  和执法完全无关
very delicate, and of no concern to law enforcement.

550
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,160
尽管我们想相信你的话
You know, as much as we'd love to, um, take your word for it,

551
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,890
但你说的这些还不够
we're gonna need a little more than that.

552
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,000
好吧  这都归结到一起私人纠纷上
All right, well, this all comes down to a personal dispute.

553
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,130
就这样
That's all.

554
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:37,900
是沃莫尔德先生
It's -- it's between, um, Mr. Wormald

555
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,820
还有他的艺术赞助人的纠纷
and, uh... his art patron.

556
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,750
-"艺术赞助人"  -没错
- "Art patron"? - ‭Yeah.

557
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:51,140
我的委托人和一个有钱人有一个协议
Uh, my client has an arrangement with a wealthy gentleman

558
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,470
沃莫尔德先生向他提供
for whom Mr. Wormald provides...

559
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,740
艺术品  以此获得他慷慨的...
art in exchange for ‭this gentleman's generous, uh...

560
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,230
我们称之为资助
We'll call it patronage.

561
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,830
艺术品  例如绘画吗
Art? Like -- like what? Paintings?

562
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,700
更像是电子媒体
It's more like digital media.

563
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,260
电子媒体
Digital media?

564
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,730
他为那个人拍视频
He made videos for the man.

565
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,380
哪种视频
What kind of videos?

566
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,610
具有艺术性的私人视频
Private videos of an artistic nature.

567
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,640
那就是藏在暗道里的东西
That's what was in the hiding place.

568
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,940
就是这样
That's what it's for.

569
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:30,720
那么这个艺术赞助人偷了视频和棒球卡吗
So, this art patron stole the videos and the baseball cards?

570
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,540
那是个误会
Well, there was a misunderstanding.

571
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,980
还是叫创意分歧比较好
I mean, uh, ‭call it creative differences.

572
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,280
艺术家都是喜怒无常的
Artists are volatile creatures.

573
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,200
伙计们  这就是情人吵架
Guys, this all comes down to just a lovers' spat, okay?

574
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,310
两个成年男子闹翻了
Two consenting adults had a falling out.

575
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,320
常有的事
That happens.

576
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,550
赞助人偷了视频
And the, uh, "Patron" stole the videos

577
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,380
还有棒球卡  我猜是为了"表明观点"
and the baseball cards, uh, to "Make a point," I guess.

578
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,050
但关键是  都解决了
But the headline here is, it's all settled.

579
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,180
感情修复了
Hearts have mended,

580
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,340
沃莫尔德先生不会起诉
and Mr. Wormald will not be pressing charges.

581
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,820
视频内容是什么
What was on these videos?

582
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,790
-很私密  -我知道
- They were private. - You've said that.

583
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,540
视频内容意在
They were videos intended

584
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,690
刺激感官
to titillate the senses.

585
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,580
-好吧  是黄片吗  -不
- Okay, so porn. - Not -- no.

586
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,460
不是这种
Not as such.

587
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,810
严格来说  应该是恋物视频
Technically, they would be categorized as fetish videos.

588
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,710
但没有违法内容
But nothing illegal.

589
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,490
就是一个男人  穿戴整齐  我补充一句
Just a man -- a fully clothed man, I might add --

590
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,710
只有他自己
Just all by himself.

591
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,500
沃莫尔德先生穿戴整齐
Just -- just Mr. Wormald fully clothed,

592
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:38,960
没错
yeah.

593
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,470
-就是这样  -好的
- So... - All right.

594
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:45,620
所以穿戴整齐的沃莫尔德先生
So, fully clothed Mr. Wormald

595
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,480
在做什么事
by himself doing what?

596
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,870
是啊  在做什么
Yeah, come on, man. What?

597
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,900
"蹲派"
Squat cobbler.

598
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,870
蹲什么玩意儿
What's a s-squat cobbler?

599
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,490
蹲派  你们知道的
Squat cobbler. ‭You know what squat cobbler is.

600
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,940
不  我不知道那是什么
No, I don't -- I don't know what a squat cobbler is.

601
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,600
我也不知道  那是什么
No, me neither. What is it?

602
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,710
你们两是警察吗
What? And you two guys are cops?

603
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,900
霍博肯蹲派
Hoboken squat cobbler.

604
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,100
满月派

波士顿奶油派
Boston cream splat.

606
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,910
真的吗
Seriously?

607
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,020
"蹲男"西蒙
Simple-simon-the-ass-man.

608
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,060
荷兰苹果蹲
Dutch apple ass.

609
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,710
伙计们  我说的不是英语吗
Guys, am I not speaking english here?

610
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,240
蹲派到底是什么
What the hell is a squat cobbler?!

611
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,360
就是一个男人坐在派里
It's when a man sits in pie!

612
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,820
他坐在派里
He sits in a pie!

613
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:37,020
还来回扭动
And he... he wiggles around.

614
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,620
也许是好乐门蛋黄酱
Maybe it's like Hellmann's mayonnaise.

615
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,800
落基山以西有不同的叫法
It has a different name west of the Rockies.

616
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,690
我也不知道  但严格来说
I don't know. But, uh, technically,

617
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,500
他是边哭边蹲的
He does a crybaby squat, so there's tears,

618
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,740
所以看起来更专业
which makes it more specialized.

619
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,740
不是所有蹲派者都要哭的
Not all pie sitters cry.

620
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,280
但我要说的是
But I'm gonna tell you something.

621
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,910
这家伙一哭起来
This guy is a regular Julianne Moore

622
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,850
演得比朱丽安·摩尔还棒
once he gets ‭the waterworks cranked up.

623
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,890
派
Pies?

624
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,020
比如苹果派吗
What? Like apple?

625
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,930
伙计  不是我拍的好吗
Guys, I'm not ‭the filmmaker here, all right?

626
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:06,070
有香蕉奶油  桃子
Banana cream. I -- uh, peach.

627
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,700
哦对  还要穿道具服装
Oh, and there -- ‭and there is a costume involved.

628
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,270
你忽悠我们呢
You got to be shitting us.

629
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,520
是啊  随便你们信不信
Yeah, like I would make this up.

630
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,240
大千世界无奇不有  兄弟
Hey, the world is ‭a rich tapestry, my friends.

631
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,270
不过相信我
But trust me on this.

632
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,000
你们不会想看的
You don't want to see it.

633
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:38,750
所以  没事了  是吧
So, uh, we're good, right?

634
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,520
是  没问题了
Yeah. Great.

635
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,240
不过  还有一个小隐患  要善后
There is, however, one little, tiny hanging chad.

636
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,170
什么  什么隐患
Well, what? What chad?

637
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,820
你得拍一个视频
You're gonna have to make a video.

638
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,700
等等等等
wait. Wait.

639
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,900
他是把馅饼吃了还是坐在馅饼里
So he eats the pies or just sits in them?

640
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,250
都有  想要什么有什么
Both. Whatever you want.

641
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,720
哪个先来
Which comes first?

642
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,700
随便
Uh, it's dealer's choice.

643
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,230
这时候就该上哭戏了  是吧
That's where the crying comes in, right?

644
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,800
哭戏是必须的
That's a safe bet.

645
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,410
你到底是怎么想出这主意的
How the hell ‭did you come up with that?

646
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,410
就是给我一百年
If you gave me a million years,

647
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,210
我也想不出这玩意
I still would not have come up with that.

648
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,210
灵感女神
The muse.

649
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,650
我说出了她的想法
She speaks through me.

650
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,660
我不过是区区传话筒
I am but a humble vessel.

651
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,150
他们信了吗
And they bought it?

652
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,600
信了
Yeah.

653
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,470
我也听说过一些很离谱让人难以相信的情节
I've heard some far-out scenarios used to sow doubt,

654
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:46,200
但这绝对是最扯淡[赢得蛋糕]的
but this definitely takes the cake.

655
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,190
金  金  金
Kim, Kim, Kim.

656
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,960
-知道啦是"馅饼"  -对
- Takes the pie. ‭- Yeah.

657
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,910
抱歉
Sorry.

658
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,850
我现在应该跳楼谢罪
I should just jump off the roof right now.

659
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,540
对啊  你是该自责
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.

660
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,360
天哪  你可真能诌
Jesus, can you tell a story.

661
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,190
我觉得其实是那视频让他们信了
Well, to be fair, I think it was the video that clinched it.

662
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,990
什么视频
What video?

663
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,880
等等  你们真的拍了一个视频
Wait, wait. You -- ‭you actually made a video?

664
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,660
不得不说  到最后  老丹还挺入戏的
I got to say, in the end, Ol' Dan really committed.

665
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,730
那眼泪把我都打动了
I believed the tears.

666
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:18,060
这个是剩下的道具  多出来的
Um, this is a leftover prop. It was extra.

667
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,810
我不确定我们要拍几条  就多买了些
I wasn't sure how many takes we would need, so I over-bought,

668
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,520
不过我保证  绝对没被屁股坐过
But I promise you, ‭untouched by human buttocks.

669
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,180
你伪造证据
You fabricated evidence?

670
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,560
我就拍了个视频
I made a video.

671
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,650
算不上证据
Not exactly evidence.

672
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,310
你用它来为委托人脱罪
You used it to exonerate a client.

673
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:37,660
你用伪造的证据为委托人脱罪
You used falsified evidence to exonerate a client.

674
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,850
你这是钻牛角尖
Mm, I think you're splitting hairs.

675
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,430
我没有钻牛角尖
I'm not splitting hairs.

676
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,860
万一戴维斯梅因律所发现你伪造证据怎么办
What if Davis & Main find out you faked evidence?

677
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:46,730
他不是戴维斯梅因律所的客户
It wasn't a Davis & Main client.

678
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,370
这不是什么案子  无偿的
It was some nothing, little pro-bono thing.

679
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,710
与工作无关  完全是  我的私事
It was off the clock. It was, uh, totally my own thing.

680
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,710
为什么
Why?

681
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,530
你为什么要冒丢工作的风险
Why would you risk the best job you've ever had

682
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,510
就为了一个无偿的案子
for some pro-bono case?

683
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,380
我是帮朋友的忙
I was doing a favor for a friend.

684
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,210
冒着被取消律师资格的风险  真是良友
Risking disbarment? That's -- that's some friend.

685
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,520
没事的  事情解决了
It's fine! It -- it worked out.

686
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,830
戴维斯梅因律所并不知情
Davis & Main are none the wiser.

687
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:10,540
吉米  你这是在玩火
Jimmy, ‭you're playing with fire here.

688
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,000
那天晚上那个混蛋肯
I didn't see you complaining

689
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,540
帮我们付酒单的时候  我可没见你抱怨
when, um, Ken the douchebag paid our bar bill the other night.

690
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,050
是吧  那也有点违反规定了吧
No, that was a little bit of rule breaking right there.

691
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,910
要是我没记错  你还挺享受的
And if I remember correctly, you liked it.

692
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:22,670
很享受
A lot.

693
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,450
这完全不是一回事
That is so not the same thing.

694
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:27,080
怎么不是一回事  有什么区别
How? What's the difference?

695
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,600
那与工作无关
That had nothing to do with work.

696
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,770
而且我们就是在胡闹
And we were just -- just screwing around.

697
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
但是这个
This?

698
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,390
伪造证据
Fabricating evidence.

699
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,350
吉米  这真的可能会害了你
Jimmy, ‭this could really hurt you.

700
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,160
如果他们发现了  如果你被抓
If they find out, if you get caught --

701
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,220
这  他们永远不会发现的
It -- they're never gonna find out.

702
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:41,850
你不是吧
Seriously?

703
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,520
这话说得就跟那些蠢蛋罪犯一模一样
You sound like every dumb criminal out there.

704
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,100
如果你再这么干  他们迟早会发现
If you keep this up, they will find out.

705
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,910
你图什么  吉米
For what, Jimmy? ‭

706
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,000
到底为了什么
What is the point?

707
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,670
你不能再做这种事情了
I cannot hear ‭about this sort of thing.

708
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,070
一次也不行了  听到了吗
Ever again. Okay?

709
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,310
我认真的  吉米
I mean it, Jimmy.

710
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,980
不会再有了
You won't.
