56
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,080
是咖啡香吗  你在煮咖啡吗
Do I smell coffee? Have you got a pot on?

57
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,090
怎么
Why?

58
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,530
帮我来一杯如何
How about a fill-up?

59
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,350

我不清楚查克具体跟你说了什么
I don't know exactly what Chuck may have said to you,

69
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,730
但你要知道  我并没有要求他帮我说话
but just so you know, i did not ask him to step in on my behalf.

70
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,150
你们好  抱歉久等
Hi, guys. Sorry for the wait.

管不住啊
Oh, outta control,

80
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,530
围着我们团团转
just running circles around all of us.

81
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,650
你好  有什么事吗
Hello. Can I help you?

82
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,450
你知道我为什么来吗
You know why I'm here?

83
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,910
他需要你的答复
He needs an answer.

84
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,630
不好意思  我不得不拒绝
Respectfully, ‭I'm gonna have to say no.

85
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,800
你确定吗
You sure about that?

86
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,340
确定
I am.

87
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,410
欢迎

88
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,080
法官大人  被告的请求很合理
Your honor, the defense has made the very reasonable request

89
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,520
请求原告公开医疗记录
that the plaintiffs produce their medical records

90
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,610
或已签字的HIPPA授权书
or, barring that, a signed HIPAA release

91
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,610
《健康保险流通与责任法案》

92
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,940
以便我方自行检查记录
so that we can examine the records ourselves.

93
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,150
法官大人  我方委托人的医疗记录
Your honor, ‭our clients' medical records

94
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,690
与此案内在是非毫无关联
have no bearing ‭on the merits of this case.

95
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,100
医疗记录与此案关联显著
The medical records are plainly relevant,

96
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
因为它们与我方观点联系紧密
as they bear directly on our contention that

97
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,080
即这些原告人并不能充分代表集体诉讼
the plaintiffs are not adequate class representatives.

98
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,670
这显然是想胁迫原告人
This is a transparent attempt at intimidation.

99
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,650
-仅此而已  -为什么
- Nothing more. - ‭How so?

100
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,670
我方委托人的医疗记录里
Many of our clients have information

101
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,370
大多都有不愿公开的隐私信息
in their medical records that they prefer to keep private.

102
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,000
他们和我们一样害怕
They're fearful, as any of us would be,

103
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,150
一群陌生人
at the thought of a bunch of strangers

104
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,440
偷看他们的私人资料
poking around ‭in their personal files,

105
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,460
如果强迫他们公开这部分信息
and by forcing them to reveal this information,

106
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,580
被告就是在胁迫他们撤诉
the defense is banking on them simply dropping out of the case.

107
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,750
法官大人  这只是集体诉讼确认而已
Your honor, this is about class certification. That's all.

108
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,420
如果名单中的原告人患有痴呆
If the named plaintiffs are suffering from dementia

109
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,460
或其他精神缺陷
or other mental deficiencies --

110
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,380
你是说他们没有行为能力吗
you're saying they're incompetent?

111
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,750
我是说为了集体诉讼确认
I'm saying we have the right to any record

112
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,510
我们有权获得证明原告
that would speak to their competency,

113
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,330
具备行为能力的任何资料
as regards this class-certification issue.

114
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,420
法官大人  被告方似乎想两者兼得
Your honor, it seems that the defense wants to have it both ways, then.

115
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,130
如果我方委托人患有痴呆
If our clients ‭are suffering from dementia,

116
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,200
那么他们最初和矶鹞渡签署住宿合同时
then the residency contracts they signed with Sandpiper

117
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,490
就不可能是知情的
couldn't have been entered into knowingly.

118
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,740
不不  我们不是这个意思
No, no. That is not what we're...

119
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,180
被告想声称
The defense wants to claim

120
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,780
居住者有能力签署合同
that their residents are competent enough to be held to their contracts

121
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,850
却没有能力起诉
but too incompetent to sue.

122
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,080
这不是很矛盾吗
So which is it?

123
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,790
许多居住者是很多年前签署合同的
Many of the residents signed their contracts years ago,

124
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,170
那时候他们完全有行为能力
and at the time, ‭they were perfectly competent.

125
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,920
但这是会变的
But that can change,

126
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,650
尤其是年岁已高的居住者
especially when we're talking about elderly individuals.

127
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,530
那么也许矶鹞渡专挑有精神疾病的老年人
Or maybe sandpiper preyed on mentally incompetent seniors

128
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,700
骗走了他们的钱财
and bilked them out of their money.

129
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,690
韦克斯勒小姐
Miss Wexler.

130
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,630
我只是在为我方委托人辩护
I am simply trying to defend our clients

131
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,500
免受被告方欺压
from bullying by the defense.

132
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,020
法官大人  正如您面前的报告中所述
Your honor, as stated in the brief in front of you,

133
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,630
这是个标准申请
this is a standard request,

134
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,400
在同类案件中均被允许
granted in every case of its kind.

135
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,390
这不是欺压
This is not about bullying.

136
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,880
允许这样的隐私侵犯
Granting this invasion of privacy

137
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,330
会让我们的委托人二次受害
allows our clients to be doubly victimized.

138
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,930
我请求您拒绝被告的动议  法官大人
I ask that you deny the defense's motion, your honor.

139
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,680
我倾向于允许这一申请
I'm leaning toward granting the motion,

140
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,120
但我想重读一下诉状和简述
but I would like to review the pleadings and briefs again.

141
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,450
我会很快答复你们
I'll have my decision for you shortly.

142
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,860
休庭
Adjourned.

143
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,260
回办公室再见
I'm gonna meet you back at the office.

144
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,440
韦克斯勒小姐  你好
Ms. Wexler. Hey.

145
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,620
我只想说  你刚才表现很好
I just wanted to say, good work in there.

146
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,190
谢谢  但我肯定输了
Thanks, but I -- I'm pretty sure I lost.

147
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,350
当然了  这种情况你赢不了的
Oh, of course you did. It's an unwinnable position.

148
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,350
所以你上司都懒得出面
That's why your boss didn't bother showing up.

149
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,060
但是你坚持不懈  虽败犹荣  我很欣赏
But you went down swinging, and I admire that.

150
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,860
谢谢
Thank you.

151
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,620
你午餐有什么安排
What are you doing for lunch?

152
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,950
可能就在自动贩卖机买点吧
Um, probably just grabbing something from the vending machines.

153
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,280
我们可以吃好一点嘛
We can do better than that.

154
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,220
斯韦卡特先生  很高兴见到你
Mr. Schweikart, good to see you, sir.

155
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,930
-你好吗  肖恩  -我很好
- Ah, how you doing, Sean? ‭- Very well.

156
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,760
要什么喝的  您还是要莫斯科之骡吗
Can I get some drinks for you two? Your usual Moscow Mule?

157
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,740
肯定的  你要吗
Absolutely. You want one?

158
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,540
全市最好的莫斯科之骡
Best Moscow Mule in the city.

159
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,150
新鲜的生姜  纯铜杯  很正宗
Fresh ginger, ‭real copper mug, the works.

160
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,330
真是复古  我不用了
That's very vintage, but I'm good.

161
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,460
冰茶就可以了
Just an iced tea.

162
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,560
你确定吗
You sure?

163
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,000
那好吧  我就独自做一个
All right, then. I'll be the sole degenerate

164
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,820
工作日中午喝酒的堕落汉吧
who's drinking ‭in the middle of a work day.

165
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,960
那也很复古了
That, too, is vintage.

166
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,220
我去让他们调
I'll get those started.

167
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,120
所以你在哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所十年了
So, you've been with HHM, what -- 10 years?

168
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,400
没错  去年八月满十年
Y-yeah, last August.

169
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,910
你是从收发室做起的吗
And you started in the mail room?

170
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,860
没错  我在那干了六年
I did. I was six years there.

171
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,880
你怎么知道的
How did you know that?

172
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,890
我问别人的  这地方很小
Oh, I asked around. It's a small town.

173
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,600
听上去你已经尽职尽责了
You know, it sounds like you certainly paid your dues.

174
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,660
我运气很好
I was very fortunate.

175
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,920
律所一边让我工作  一边供我读完法学院
HHM put me through law school while I worked.

176
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,100
他们很会培养人才啊
That's great that ‭they foster talent like that.

177
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,890
现在你给他们工作  就当还债是吧
And I imagine you're paying it off as part of your deal?

178
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,140
是的  我很乐意
Yeah, happily.

179
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,180
好多人都是这样的安排
It's a pretty standard arrangement.

180
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,870
我得说  今天看你在法庭上
I have to say, ‭watching you in court today,

181
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,190
确实勾起我不少回忆
it sure did bring back some old memories for me.

182
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,270
反正让我想起了一件事
One in particular, anyway.

183
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,350
-是吗  -是的
- Yeah? - ‭Yeah.

184
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,910
我当时从法学院毕业一年  在波士顿一家律所
I was a year out of law school at this firm in Boston,

185
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,060
我终于接了第一个大案子
and I was finally put on my first big case --

186
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,880
一桩大型就业歧视案
This huge ‭employment-discrimination suit.

187
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,820
这案子让律所十年都有活干
That thing kept us in billing for a decade.

188
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,680
总之  我们接了这单大的
Anyway, we landed this monster,

189
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,250
而且我成为了预审听证时
and I find out I'm second chair to one of the partners

190
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,540
一位合伙人的助理律师
on the preliminary hearing,

191
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,390
我就想  "就是它了
and I think, "This is it.

192
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,880
"我之后的职业生涯全靠这一搏了"
"This is what will define the rest of my career."

193
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,870
听证会越来越近
So, the hearing's getting closer and closer,

194
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,720
我甚至买了一件负担不起的西装
I even get this new suit that I can't afford --

195
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,570
我分三张信用卡刷的
I split it over three credit cards.

196
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,440
可能现在还在还钱
I'm probably still paying it off to this day.

197
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,360
我一大早就去了  穿着我的新西装
So, I go in bright and early, I'm wearing my new suit,

198
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,170
准备桌上的材料  这时抗辩方走进来
prepping my table, and in walks the opposing counsel.

199
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,480
他们有四个人  一个高级合伙人
There's four of them -- one senior partner

200
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,140
还有三个高级律师
and three high-level associates.

201
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,860
我还没出生他们就开始干这行了
These guys have been litigating longer than I've been alive.

202
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,740
但我想的是  "没什么大不了的
But I think, "Mm, I'm good.

203
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,640
"我老板来了就没事了"
"I got my boss coming. It'll be fine."

204
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,150
我就一个人坐在桌前
So, I'm sitting alone, at my table,

205
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,030
等着老板现身
waiting for my boss to show.

206
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:32,930
我等啊等
And I'm waiting.

207
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,380
等啊等
And I'm waiting.

208
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,700
突然  他们宣布开庭
And then, suddenly, ‭they're calling us to order,

209
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,670
我才意识到我的律所没人来
and I realize that no one from my firm is coming.

210
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,770
只有我一个
It's just me.

211
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,180
我心想  "好吧
So I think, "All right, then.

212
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,800
"是时候了"
"This is the moment."

213
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,910
我上前拼了老命地辩论
And I get up there, and I argue like my life depended on it.

214
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,130
汗流浃背  旁征博引
I'm sweating, and I'm citing statutes left and right.

215
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,970
我表现得还行
And I'm doing okay. Respectable.

216
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,240
但我这把BB枪难敌四架榴弹炮
But I'm just a BB gun to these four howitzers.

217
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,510
我当然输了
And I lose, of course.

218
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,360
不可避免
It was inevitable.

219
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,890
但之后我突然意识到
But later, it hit me

220
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,450
我的老板根本就没打算到场
that my boss never intended to show.

221
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,620
他们都一笑而过
And they all laughed about it.

222
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,460
拍着我背说  那是对我的考验
They patted me on the back, said it was my trial by fire,

223
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,230
我也跟他们一起笑  但你知道
and I laughed with them, but, you know,

224
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,630
我觉得很不好受
It never really sat well with me.

225
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,350
你需要他们的支持
You want them to have your back.

226
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,840
因为最后我才知道
Because at the end of the day,

227
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,110
那不是为了考验我的勇气
it wasn't about proving my mettle.

228
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,370
而是我老板不想错过高尔夫
My boss had a tee time that he didn't want to miss.

229
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,040
我在那儿没待多久
I wasn't there long.

230
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,170
可以问下你为什么叫我...来这吗
Could I ask why we... are here?

231
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,070
我已经注意你很久了
You know, I've had my eye on you for a while.

232
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,380
自从凯特尔曼一案开始
Since that Kettleman thing.

233
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,600
你真是为他搞定了一桩极好的案子
That was an excellent deal you got for him.

234
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,370
我想知道为什么
And I'm wondering why someone

235
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,370
一个可以搞定那一单的人
who could put together a deal like that

236
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,990
没有后援  明知要输  却还要辩护
is arguing a losing position with no backup.

237
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,490
我对哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所没有怨言
I have no complaints about HHM.

238
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,140
很好
That's great.

239
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,510
但是  如果你碰巧正在寻求改变
However, if on the off chance, if you're pondering a change,

240
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,320
斯韦卡特考科利会很乐意
Schweikart and Cokely would be more than happy

241
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,050
善用你的才华
to put your talents to good use.

242
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,780
当然我们得有更正式的会面
Of course, we'd have to have a more formal meeting,

243
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,010
讨论细节  但我们认为你会非常合适
work out specifics, but we think you would be a great fit.

244
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,400
我受宠若惊
Well, I'm -- I'm flattered,

245
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,950
但这明显存在职业道德问题
but there's clearly an ethical issue here.

246
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,940
当然是等你弄完矶鹞渡的案子
Well, of course, ‭we'd take you off Sandpiper.

247
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,950
你放心
And rest assured,

248
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,810
我们不想要哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所的
we wouldn't be expecting any information

249
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,880
任何策略信息
about HHM strategy.

250
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,790
我们是一家大规模多元化的律所
Look, we're a large, diversified firm.

251
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,050
想想你可以用我们的资源成就什么
And just think what you can do with our resources

252
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,630
可以自由地展翅翱翔
and the freedom ‭to really spread your wings.

253
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,760
这...
That's...

254
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,080
我亏欠哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所很多
I owe a lot to HHM.

255
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,920
学费债务吗  我们可以替你偿还
Your tuition debt? ‭We can take care of that.

256
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,170
真慷慨
That's very generous.

257
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,100
花点时间考虑一下
Well, give it some time to think about it.

258
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,000
你来电话  我们就安排会面
And you give me a call, and we'll set up a meeting

259
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,700
会见其他高级合伙人
with the rest of the senior partners.

260
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,300
先说清楚...
And to be clear...

261
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,040
我说的可是合伙人机会
I'm talking partner track.

262
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,580
天哪肖恩  你是在莫斯科调的酒吗
Jesus, Sean, what -- what'd you have to send to Moscow?

263
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,740
抱歉让您久等了  斯韦卡特先生
Sorry for the wait, Mr. Schweikart.

264
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,690
可以点餐了吗
Are we ready to order?

265
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,100
...梅斯向您推荐这款快速切菜机
...Mays here for the gourmet quick chop.

266
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,040
它可以十分快捷  简便  安全地
It's the fastest, easiest, and safest way

267
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,390
将蔬菜切碎或切块
to chop, mince, or dice any vegetable, guaranteed.

268
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,570
操作方法如下
Here's how it works.

269
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,610
放好蔬菜
Just place the vegetable on the board,

270
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,680
按下按键
give it tap

271
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,150
立刻就有了做沙拉用的细细切碎的卷心菜
and you've got finely shredded cabbage in seconds for crunchy coleslaw.

272
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,180
再按一下...
tap again and chop...

273
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,440
趴下
Get down. ‭

274
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,180
趴下
Get down.

275
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,810
要带什么话
What's the message?

276
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,820
收下那五千块
Take the $5,000.

277
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,160
这么一句话需要两个人来跟我说
It took two guys to tell me that?

278
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,520
我们只是来吓吓你  仅此而已
We were just supposed to scare you, that's all.

279
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,570
那下次更狠一点
You try harder next time.

280
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,550
滚出去
Get out.

281
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,170
滚
Get out!

282
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,210
朱莉  进来吧
Oh, hey, Julie. Come on in.

283
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,710
我这有一些矶鹞渡的文件
I've got ‭those Sandpiper documents.

284
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,220
好  先放这吧
Great. Just put them anywhere.

285
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,500
霍华德说要你立刻处理
Howard asked if you could go through them now.

286
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,960
已经一点一刻了  我正要去吃午饭
It's 1:15. I was just about to grab some lunch.

287
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,680
两点半之前要处理好  他要用来起草文件
Yeah, he needs them done by 2:30 so he can draft a letter.

288
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,210
我带来了这个
I brought these.

289
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,870
我可以用备用金帮你点个外卖
Figured I could petty-cash a lunch order for you.

290
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,010
我得到财务的许可了  能从那家新沙拉店点餐
I got accounting to approve that new fancy salad place.

291
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,230
凯莉
Kaylee!

292
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,240
凯莉
Kaylee!

293
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,610
过来  别离泳池边太远
Come on, ‭not too far from the side.

294
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,430
把球丢过来  爷爷
Throw the ball, pop-pop!

295
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,070
我们什么时候回家
When are we going home?

296
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,320
怎么了  你不喜欢这里吗
What? You don't like it here?

297
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,110
还好吧
