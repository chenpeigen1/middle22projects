吉米  扫地扫得怎么样了
Jimmy, how's that sweepin' going?

4
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,650
扫着呢  老爸
Goin' good, pop.

5
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,070
你好吗
Hi. How are ya?

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,230
你好  先生
Hello, sir.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,600
不知道你能不能帮我个忙
Uh, I was wondering if maybe you could help me.

8
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,470
什么事
Yeah?

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,790
我今早开车进城
Well, I drove into the city this morning.

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,890
通常我都搭火车  但今天特别赶时间
U-usually, I take the train, but I was in just such a rush

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,250
急着给我儿子弗莱迪买药
to get some medicine for my son, Freddie.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,260
他有癫痫
He has epilepsy.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,260
今天早上发作的时候
He had an attack this morning, but during his fit,

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,620
打翻了我妻子手中的药
he knocked the bottle of medicine out of my wife's hand

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,140
砰一声  撒了一地
and just -- bam, one huge puddle.

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,320
真糟糕
That's terrible.

17
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,240
长话短说吧  我开车进城
Well, long story short -- drove into town,

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,630
身上所有钱都拿去买了药
bought the new medicine with every last nickel in my pocket,

19
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,560
接着我的车就抛锚了
and then my car died.

20
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,760
我的天  这实在...
Oh, god, that's -- that's just, uh...

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,710
我知道
I know.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,690
屋漏偏逢连夜雨  对吧
When it rains, it pours, right?

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,110
我试着发动  怎么也点不着
I-I tried the ignition, just nothin' -- not firing.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,060
总之  我只知道
And, anyway, now I've convinced myself

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,770
在我带药回家之前
that Freddie's ‭gonna have another seizure

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,660
弗莱迪的癫痫随时会再次发作
before I get back with the medicine.

27
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,500
要是你能帮我  我会感激不尽
So, i-if you can help me, I would be so grateful.

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,870
我可以帮你检查一下车子
Well, I could come out and check your car for ya.

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,270
可能只是火花塞的问题
You know, ‭maybe it's just a spark plug.

30
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,940
我储藏室里有一盒火花塞
I-I-I got a box of plugs back in the stockroom.

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,360
谢谢  我很感激
Thanks, ‭and I-I appreciate that,

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,880
但如果你能给我五块就好了...
but if you could possibly just spare $5 instead...

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,090
我宁可打车也不愿再折腾我那破车
I'd rather grab a cab than take a chance with my old clunker.

34
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,920
好啊  五元
Yeah, $5.

35
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,660
如果能给的话
I-if you can spare it.

36
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,180
行  当然
Yeah, okay, sure.

37
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,460
爸  过来一下
Dad, c'mere!

38
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,670
过来一下
C'mere!

39
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,230
爸  这是诈骗  跟上周那个乞丐一样
Dad, it's a rip-off, just like that bum from last week.

40
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,830
吉米
Jimmy.

41
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,590
镇上的骗棍都知道
Every grifter in town knows that

42
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,010
这里是骗取施舍的好地点
this is the spot to come for an easy handout.

43
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,010
"骗棍"  你哪里学来的词
Grifter? Where in the world did you learn that word?

44
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,080
爸  他鬼话连篇
Dad, his story's baloney.

45
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,050
他多半根本没有儿子
He probably doesn't even have a son.

46
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,890
他在敲诈你
He's conning you.

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,180
吉米  万一你错了呢
Jimmy... What if you're wrong?

48
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,910
这样吧
Y-you know what?

49
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,960
很抱歉麻烦你们  我这就走
Sorry to bother you folks. I-I'm gonna get outta here.

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,050
-我这就...  -不不不
- I-I'm gonna... - No, no, no, no, no.

51
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,660
-爸  -不  不麻烦
- Dad. - ‭No, no bother.

52
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,130
来吧  这儿
Come on. Now, here.

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,460
给你十元吧
There's $10 for you.

54
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,090
先生  你...
Sir, y-you're --

55
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,460
真的很慷慨
That's -- that is so generous.

56
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,400
没事  这样吧
Of course, and -- and you know what?

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,770
我去后面储藏室
I'm gonna go back in the stockroom.

58
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,930
找点火花塞
I'm gonna find those spark plugs.

59
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,670
或许能帮你把车发动  如何
Maybe we'll get your car started for you, okay?

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,120
来吧  吉米  帮我看一会儿行吗
Come on, Jimmy. Just man the till, okay?

61
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,600
我马上回来
And I'll just be back in a jiff, okay?

62
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,440
一条酷尔烟多少钱
How much for a carton of Kools?

63
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,280
四块钱
4 bucks.

64
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,580
好  来一条
Yeah, gimme a carton.

65
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,990
先付钱
Money first.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,990
来两条吧
Gimme two cartons.

67
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,260
天啊
Oh, gosh.

68
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,710
火花塞分明就在这里
These spark plugs are back here somewhere.

69
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,380
再给我一分钟好吗
Just give me one more minute, okay?

70
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,210
快点吧
Come on.

71
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,460
这世上有两类人  狼和羊  孩子
There are wolves and sheep in this world, kid.

72
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,790
狼和羊
Wolves and sheep --

73
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,320
想清楚你要成为哪一种
Figure out ‭which one you're gonna be.

74
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,760
等等
Wait. Just...Just...

75
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,090
好啦  找到了
Okay, I-I found the, um...

76
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,490
他走了吗
Did he leave?

77
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,400
他刚走吗
Oh, did he just leave?

78
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,670
先生
Sir!

79
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,490
别让我打扰你
Don't let me interrupt.

80
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,360
抱歉  准备好了吗
Sorry. You ready?

81
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,440
走吧  赶紧把这事解决了
Hey, come on. Let's get this over with.

82
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,290
感谢您抽空见我们
Thank you for seeing us.

83
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,030
我们不想耽误太久
We don't wanna take up too much of your time,

84
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,700
我就开门见山吧
so I'll get right to it.

85
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,660
很遗憾地告诉你们  经过事后回忆
Um, I regret to inform you that with the benefit of hindsight,

86
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,290
厄门绍特先生决定小小地修改一下陈述
Mr. Ehrmantraut will be amending his original statement a tad.

87
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,860
-小小地  -一点点
- A tad? ‭- A wee bit.

88
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,780
他决定不能再昧着良心
He's decided that he can no longer in good conscience claim

89
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,870
说现场发现的枪是屠库·塞拉曼加的
claim that the gun found at the scene belonged to Tuco Salamanca.

90
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,050
-那是谁的枪呢  -谁知道呢
- So, whose gun was it? ‭- Who's to say?

91
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,210
你知道阿尔布开克有多少枪吗
You know how many guns there are in Albuquerque?

92
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,640
少如响尾蛇  多则如沙粒
Somewhere between the number of rattlesnakes and grains of sand.

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,200
反正很多
So...a lot.

94
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,190
是你的枪吗  厄门绍特先生
Was it your gun, Mr. Ehrmantraut?

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,500
他没这么说
No, he's not saying that.

96
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,170
能让厄门绍特先生自己说吗
Can we hear it from Mr. Ehrmantraut?

97
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,860
枪不是塞拉曼加的
The gun wasn't Salamanca's.

98
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,260
我只知道这么多
That's all I can tell you.

99
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,740
你原来说是他的
You told us it was.

100
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,500
你说塞拉曼加掏出枪指着你
You said Salamanca pulled it and pointed it at you.

101
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:43,990
他没有
Well, he didn't.

102
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,780
-你为什么要改陈述  -好公民嘛
- Why are you changing your story? ‭- Good citizenship.

103
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,260
枪上只有一个人的指纹
Look, there was only one set of prints on the gun --

104
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,560
塞拉曼加的
Salamanca's.

105
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,580
枪怎么可能不是他的呢
How's that gonna happen if it wasn't his?

106
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,520
这个就不能问我的委托人了  对吧
That's not really for my client to say, now, is it?

107
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,490
他又不是鉴定专家
He's not a forensics expert.

108
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,740
谁知道呢  说不定
Who knows? Maybe it, uh,

109
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,300
是从飞过的鸟儿嘴里掉下来的
fell ‭from a passing bird's beak,

110
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,670
塞拉曼加先生接住了枪想扔掉
and Mr. Salamanca caught it and tried to throw it away.

111
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,730
可能性多了去了
I mean, ‭the possibilities are endless.

112
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,720
塞拉曼加威胁你了吗  厄门绍特先生
Did Salamanca threaten you, Mr. Ehrmantraut?

113
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,530
我们想让他多关几年
We wanna put this guy away for years.

114
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,930
枪是最关键的  你们知道
The gun makes all the difference. You know that.

115
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,040
你想让他早点出来再次伤害你吗
You gonna let this person victimize you twice?

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,010
别说枪的事了  行吗
Forget about the gun, all right?

117
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,660
枪不是塞拉曼加的
The gun was not Salamanca's.

118
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,620
如果你们要把枪纳为证据
If you try to introduce it into evidence,

119
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,630
厄门绍特先生会帮被告人辩护
Mr. Ehrmantraut ‭will make himself available to the defense,

120
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,170
他会澄清是非
and he will set the record straight,

121
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,670
直截了当  毫不含糊
categorically and unequivocally.

122
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,160
他威胁你了  还是贿赂你了
Did he threaten you or pay you off?

123
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,340
够了  到此为止  走吧
Okay, that's it. We're done. Okay. Let's go.

124
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,840
你没做错
You're doing the right the thing.

125
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,920
这个叫塞拉曼加的
This Salamanca character?

126
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,280
简直是疯子
Maniac.

127
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,150
我自己也
I had my own...

128
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,970
跟他打过交道
...thing with him.

129
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,550
之前因为利益冲突啊啥的  就没有说
I didn't wanna say it before because of conflict of interest,

130
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,990
但是他确实是个神经病
yadda yadda, but, yeah, he's nuts.

131
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,630
他把我五花大绑带到沙漠里
I'm talking he had me hog-tied in the desert

132
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,520
拿枪顶着我脑袋
with a gun to my head.

133
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,480
当着我的面折了两个家伙的腿
Broke two guys' legs right in front of me.

134
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,750
要是我没说服他  他可能就把他们...
If I hadn't talked him down, he probably would've...

135
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,810
血淋淋的细节就不谈了  总之很惨
I'll spare you the gory details, but it was a deal and a half --

136
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,590
让人永生难忘啊
not something you forget.

137
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,300
你跟我说这些干嘛
And you're telling me this why?

138
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,250
别太苛责自己
Don't be too tough on yourself.

139
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,700
人们说  谨慎即大勇
Like they say, discretion is the better part of valor.

140
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,350
换我也会这样做
I would've done the same thing.

141
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,960
今天算我帮你  不收费
Hey, today, ‭it's on me -- no charge.

142
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,410
你搭下趟电梯
You take the next one.

143
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,980
照常收费
And bill me.

144
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,460
忘恩负义
Ingrate.

145
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,060
喂  吉米
Hey, Jimmy.

146
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,490
你跟霍华德说了吗
Did you tell Howard yet?

147
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,470
我现在还不能说
I can't really talk right now.

148
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,670
你没跟他说啊
You didn't tell him.

149
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,400
还没  等确定了我才能说
No, and I won't until it's rock-solid,

150
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,260
要等到录用通知书到手
like offer-letter-in-hand solid.

151
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,380
你什么时候能拿到录用通知书
When are you gonna get that offer letter?

152
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,210
下礼拜四吧
‭I'm guessing next Thursday,

153
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,840
跟合伙人面试过以后
After my interview with the partners.

154
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,680
-那只是走个流程吧  -差不多
- Yeah, but that's just a formality, right? ‭- Basically.

155
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,760
希望是
I hope.

156
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,050
到底给你开的什么条件
What's the offer you think?

157
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,860
我是说实质的
I mean, brass tacks.

158
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,920
比不上你在戴维斯梅因律所的
Well, it's not gonna be as much as your deal at Davis & Main,

159
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,960
但是两年后可以成为合伙人
but they'll make me partner in two years,

160
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,910
而在HHM需要五年或者永远不能
as opposed to somewhere between five years and never at HHM.

161
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,280
不错嘛
Not too shabby.

162
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,300
还帮我还法学院贷款
Yeah, and then there's my law-school loans.

163
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,870
还要还多少  几千块吗
What is that -- a couple grand by now?

164
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,690
只有几千就好了
I wish.

165
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,710
我还有其他开支
I had to finance the whole thing

166
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,980
当时还拿的是收发室工资
and was only making mailroom money.

167
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,180
还剩一万五没有还完
I've got ‭like $15,000 left.

168
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,800
斯韦卡特还真是想挖你啊
Schweikart wants you bad, huh?

169
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,230
但是  吉米
But, J -- but, Jimmy,

170
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,470
你找我有什么事
Did you have something you needed?

171
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,210
不不  就打电话问问
No, no. I was just checking in.

172
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,830
一会儿见  好吗
Uh, I'll see you later, okay?

173
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,580
如果你表现好的话
If you play your cards right.

174
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,420
拜拜
Bye.

175
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,640
奥马尔  你在哪
Omar, where are you?

176
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,120
奥马尔  帮我写封信行吗
Omar, would you be so kind as to take a letter for me?

177
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,900
"最亲爱的克利福德"  不  太过了
"Dearest Clifford..." No, that's too much.

178
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,980
"亲爱的克利福"
"Dear Cliff..."

179
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,500
你觉得应该叫克利福德还是克里福
Whaddaya think -- Clifford or Cliff?

180
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,050
我不知道  要看是什么信吧
I don't -- it depends on what the letter is.

181
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,810
没事  你看着写吧
That's fine. Treat yourself.

182
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,420
亲爱的  加什么都可以
Uh, "Dear..." Whoever you put in.

183
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,800
接下来  "我的心沉重得就像"
Continuing -- ‭uh, "My heart is heavy as --"

184
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,390
不行  听起来像是生病了
No, that sounds like a medical condition.

185
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
这么写吧
Let's go with, um,

186
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,110
"我怀着沉重的心情"  好吧
"It is with a heavy heart," Okay?

187
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,580
"我怀着沉重的心情向戴维斯梅因律所
"It is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation

188
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,480
"正式提交辞呈"
"to Davis & Main."

189
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,860
用"提交"比"上交"好吧
"Tender" is better than "Submit," Yeah?

190
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,760
你说辞呈吗
Resignation?

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,840
是啊
Yes, sir.

192
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,900
"向戴维斯梅因律所提交...
So, "Tender," Blah, blah, blah, "To Davis & Main.

193
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,640
"在这里工作的日子
"These have been, uh,

194
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,240
"是我一生中最有职业成就感的一段时期"
"some of the most professionally satisfying days of my life..."

195
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,640
怎么了
What's wrong?

196
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,600
是不是说得有点过了
Do you think ‭I'm laying it on too thick?

197
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,840
不是...
No, um...

198
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,600
我只是没想到你在这里这么受气
I just didn't realize how unhappy you were here.

199
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,830
不是受气
Not unhappy, per se.

200
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,650
而是...不开心
More like... Not happy.

201
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,040
我完全没看出来
I had no idea.

202
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,520
不是你的错  伙计
‭It's not your fault, buddy.

203
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,450
你很能干
It's just -- you're top-notch.

204
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,800
我们写到哪了
Where were we?

205
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,580
可是你那么努力才争取到这一切
It's just y-you worked so hard to get here,

206
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,510
现在放弃的话你会失去很多
and it's so much to give up --

207
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,280
单说你的特别待遇
I-I mean, the perks alone.

208
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,080
是啊
Yeah.

209
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,740
公寓确实...不错
The apartment is, uh... Yeah.

210
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,360
还有车
And the car.

211
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,660
那辆车整体上是相当不错的
For the most part, car is pretty sweet.

212
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,930
还有签约奖金
And the bonus.

213
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,210
奖金已经到手了
The bonus is a done deal.

214
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,670
他们早就把支票给我了
It's -- ‭they already cut me the check.

215
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,690
奖金我可以留着
I get to keep the bonus.

216
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,560
除非你辞职
Not if you quit.

217
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,220
在一定时间内辞职  我记得你的是一年内
Before a certain term -- I think yours is a year --

218
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,090
你就要把钱还回来
You have to pay the money back.

219
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,670
是...
It's, um...

220
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,530
这个...
Yeah, uh, um...

221
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,360
对  就是这里...
Uh, uh, yeah, it's, uh...

222
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,050
应该是这儿
I think it's right, uh, there.

223
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,910
我看看
Yeah.

224
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,760
奥马尔  这个
Omar...That whole, ‭uh,

225
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,660
辞职信的事情
letter-of-resignation thing

226
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,290
我不是认真的  一个字也不作数
that -- I didn't mean that, not a word.

227
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,290
我...
I...

228
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,880
我只是  压力太大了
I-I'm so incredibly stressed out.

229
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,790
压力太大
I'm stressed out.

230
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,750
而且  坦白说
And frank-- to be honest,

231
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,830
适应戴维斯梅因的工作节奏
it has been more of an adjustment

232
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,290
比我预想中更困难
than I expected here at Davis & Main.

233
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,560
所以我有点  别把我刚才说的告诉别人
And so I just -- don't repeat what I said to anyone.

234
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,020
我就觉得有些不对劲
I figured ‭something had to be wrong --

235
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,790
肯定不对劲  因为你很喜欢在这里工作吧
I mean, really wrong because you like it here, right?

236
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,790
爱死了
I love it.

237
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:16,990
刚刚  就当是一瞬间失去理智吧
It -- call it ?A momentary lapse of reason.

238
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,670
我们
And but just --

239
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,350
我们忘了这回事吧
Let's just rewind the tape and, you know, forget this happened.

240
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,500
没问题  绝对不说出去
Mum's the word. No problem.

241
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,900
我感觉好多了
Yeah, I feel better already.

242
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,310
有时候必须把想说的大声发泄出来
I -- you know, sometimes, you have to say something out loud

243
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,000
才知道那听起来有多荒唐
to hear how crazy it sounds.

244
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,090
谢谢你  奥马尔
Thank you, Omar.

245
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,400

你好  吉米·麦吉尔
Hi, Jimmy Mcgill.

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,150
你在干什么
What are you doing?

252

道格  给办公室弄了台榨汁器
Hey, Doug! ‭Got a juicer for the office!

-好的  两杯  马上  -吉米
- Sure, you can! Two coming right up! - Jimmy --

256
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,220
有时候塞太多会堵住
Sometimes, it gets a little jammed.

257
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,080
你得用力才行  像这样
You just got to force it. Yeah!

258
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,520
天哪
Oh, shit!

259
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,940
该死  溅得到处都是
Shi-- I'm -- I'm spreading it around.

260
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,850
-溅到你身上了吗  -没有
- Did I get you? ‭- Nah.

261
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,870
现在弄上了
I -- oh, ‭now I got you with this.

262
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,470
天哪  吉米
For Christ's sakes, Jimmy!

263
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,500
只能倒着来  明白吗
Backwards only -- solo backward-o, yeah?

264
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,210
因为这样才有吸力  杠杆原理啥的
Because, uh, you've got suction that way, leverage.

265
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,080
这是物理  物理
It's physics -- el physico!

266
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,460
克利福德先生希望地板干干净净
Oh, Don Clifford wants his floors clean --

267
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,150
清洁干净
limpio, limpiar.

268
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,490
明白吗[以上对话夹杂西语]
Uh. Comprende?

269
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,430
老兄  我是密歇根人
Dude, I'm from Michigan.

270
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,860
所以我刚才说的你一个字都听不懂
So you don't understand a word I've been saying.

271
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,770
那好吧
Well...

272
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,650
晚安
Good night.

273
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,790
来  你试一下  倒着吸
No, you try. Backwards.

274
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,190
不好意思
Excuse me.

275
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,270
请大家注意一下
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

276
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,510
都能听见吗  很好
Everyone can hear me? Good.

277
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,110
坦白说  我从没想到
Frankly, this is not a conversation

278
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,180
在自己的职业生涯中要进行这种讲话
I ever thought I would have in my professional career,

279
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,060
但我注意到
but it's been brought to my attention

280
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,910
洗手间出了状况
that we have an ongoing situation in the washroom.

281
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,550
有人上完不冲水
Someone is not flushing.

282
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,890
一次是意外  两次也是
Once is an accident -- maybe even twice.

283
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,500
三次就形成模式了
Three times -- no, that's a pattern.

284
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,950
而且还不是小便
And we're not talking about a number one.

285
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,810
是的  谢谢你  艾琳
Yes. Thank you, Erin.

286
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,880
我不是来给谁难堪的
Now, I'm not here to shame anyone --

287
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,120
我都不想知道是谁干的  但是...
Nor do I even want to know who did it, but --

288
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,410
克利福德  是我干的
Uh, Cliff, it was me.

289
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,200
吉米  我说了我不想知道
Jimmy, I just said I didn't want to know.

290
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,730
我们要节约水
Hey, we need the water.

291
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,230
我了解到圣达菲的水位
I read somewhere that the Santa Fe watershed

292
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,350
今年下降了五厘米
is down ‭two full inches this year.

293
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,270
每冲一次水
Every time you flush a toilet,

294
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,460
都会浪费一加仑水  一加仑呢
you waste a gallon of water -- a gallon!

295
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,250
还有比不冲水更好的节约方法吗
What could be greater than this?

296
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,000
那些都是低流马桶  吉米
They're low-flow toilets, Jimmy.

297
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,640
从现在开始  你要冲水
From now on, flush.

298
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,110
低流  不错啊
Low-flow -- that's good.

299
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,190
好主意
Good thinking.

300
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,870
什么声音
What is that?

301
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,250
吉米  里面怎么回事
Jimmy, ‭what's goin' on in there?

302
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,820
吉米
Jimmy!

303
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,400
你隔着门也能听见吗
Oh, you could hear this through the door?

304
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,810
我没注意到  抱歉
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

305
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,470
你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

306
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,990
我接受了你的建议
Uh, I took your advice.

307
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,450
释放压力
I'm blowing off steam.

308
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,270
释放压力
Blowing off steam?

309
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,750
是啊  就像你弹吉他一样
Yeah, yeah, like you and your guitar, you know?

310
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,370
不得不说  你说得没错
Um, I got to say -- you're right.

311
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,560
这非常有助于缓解压力
I mean, ‭it really helps with stress.

312
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,000
声音不怎么好听  但我刚学
I know I don't sound very good, but I'm just learning.

313
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,910
我听说关键是要一直让这个气囊充气
I heard that the key is you have to keep this bag inflated.

314
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,090
够了
Enough!

315
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,650
赶紧给我放下来
Put that down. Now.

316
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,380
你来我办公室一趟
I want you in my office.

317
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
你赢了
You win.

318
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,510
我赢了什么
What do I win?

319
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,690
你被炒了
You're fired.

320
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,980
什么  克利福德  如果是因为那个风笛
What? Cliff, if this is about the bagpipes --

321
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,310
不是因为那个风笛
It's not about the bagpipes.

322
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,430
当然是因为风笛了
Well, of course it's the bagpipes.

323
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,930
是因为风笛  是因为不冲水
It's the bagpipes, ‭and it's the not flushing

324
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,840
还因为你这身...扎眼的所谓西裝
And this -- this optical migraine you call a business suit.

325
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,430
是因为...是因为你想保住你的奖金
It's about -- it's about you keeping your bonus.

326
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,830
都是因为这个
That's what this is about.

327
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,960
你最近一直在温习合同法吧
Been brushing up on ‭your contract law, haven't you?

328
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,670
你显然想离开这里
You want outta here, clearly,

329
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,060
但你不能辞职  否则奖金不保
But you can't just up and quit and expect to keep your bonus.

330
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,200
如果我因为你的不当行为解雇你
And if I fire you for cause --

331
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,120
在你拍广告时我就应该炒了你...
Like I should have done for the TV commercial --

332
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,290
奖金也没有
Again, no bonus.

333
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,620
但是  
However,

334
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,940
如果无缘无故  就因为你是个混蛋而解雇你
if I fire you not for cause but for being an all-around jackass...

335
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,240
你就得逞了
Yeah.. ‭Hurray for you.

336
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,560
如果你认为我有什么渎职行为...
If you think there's been some malfeasance here --

337
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,750
省省吧
Oh, save it.

338
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,270
我可以和你争  但我不想浪费时间
I could fight you on this, but you're not worth my time.

339
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,530
你最好赶紧走人
I'd rather just have you gone.

340
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,300
你这么想我很抱歉
I'm sorry you feel that way.

341
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,780
我去...收拾东西
I'll just, uh... pack up.

342
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,820
首先...行行好
First... Do me the favor

343
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,060
不要把我当傻子
of not treating me like a fool for once.

344
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,880
告诉我  我到底对你哪里不好了
Tell me -- ‭how exactly did I mistreat you?

345
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,870
我到底做了什么让你这样对我
What did I do to deserve is kind of behavior?

346
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,070
我们给了你机会  鼓励你发展
We gave you opportunities, encouraged you to excel.

347
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,440
给你配了车  配了房
We got you a car, an apartment.

348
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,210
还有黄檀木办公桌
Hell, that cocobolo desk.

349
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,860
你在这儿看到过那样的桌子吗
Do you see a desk like that in here?

350
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,970
你根本没有认真考虑
You never gave this a chance.

351
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,980
为什么
Why?

352
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,940
我努力想要适应  真的
I tried to make it work -- really, I-I did.

353
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,290
我只是...不适合这里
I'm just... a square peg.

354
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,930
如果你早就知道  为什么还要接受这份工作
If you knew that, why did you take the job?

355
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,810
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,070
那张桌子多少钱
How much was the desk?

357
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,820
七千
$7,000.

358
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,390
我会给你开张支票
I'll write you a check.

359
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,300
随便  虽然不知道有什么用
Fine, ‭for whatever good that does.

360
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,140
带上你的桌子离开这里
Take your desk and get out.

361
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,900
克利福德  不管怎样  我觉得你是一个好人
Hey, Cliff, for what it's worth, I think you're a good guy.

362
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,250
不管怎样  我觉得你是一个混蛋
For what it's worth, I think you're an asshole.

363
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,650
哈姆林先生
抱歉通知你  我将辞去

364
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,390
门开着
Uh, yeah, it's open.

365
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,470
-吉米  -我能和你谈谈吗
- Jimmy. ‭- Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute?

366
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,220
霍华德知道你来吗
Does Howard know you're here?

367
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,190
当然不知道  我溜进来的
God, no. I snuck in.

368
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,160
好吧  但是快点
Well, uh, yeah, but make it quick.

369
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,830
其实  我们能不能去会议室谈
Actually, can we, uh, talk in the conference room?

370
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,780
为什么
Why?

371
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,530
这样更正式
It's just more appropriate.

372
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,830
四点之前没人要开会  我看过了
Um, no one's gonna need it till 4:00 -- I checked.

373
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,790
行吗
Please?

374
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,160
最多十分钟
10 minutes, tops.

375
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,750
你先请
After you.

376
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,790
坐吧
‭Have a seat.

377
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,730
怎么...怎么回事
What -- what is going on?

378
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,700
说吧
Spill it.

379
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,410
好吧
Okay.

380
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,830
斯韦卡特考科利会帮你付清欠哈姆林麦吉尔的债务
Schweikart and Cokely will pay your debt to HHM

381
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,230
并在两年之后将你提拔为合伙人吧
and make you a partner in two years, correct?

382
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,420
显然是的
Apparently.

383
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,610
是这么约定的  怎么了
That's the deal, yes. Why?

384
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,050
要不要考虑一个更好的工作机会
Would you entertain a better offer?

385
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,480
谁给的  哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所吗
From whom -- HHM?

386
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,560
我
From me.

387
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,740
我明天就让你成为合伙人
I'll make you a partner tomorrow.

388
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,600
以此为证
Consider that proof of concept --

389
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,660
韦克斯勒麦吉尔联合律所
Wexler-Mcgill, partners at law.

390
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,430
你和我一起
You and me, together.

391
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,230
斯韦卡特可以帮你偿还债务  我也可以
If Schweikart can pay your debt, so can I.

392
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,020
再加上我的签约奖金
And with my signing bonus,

393
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,890
你就可以从头开始了
you'll have a clean slate.

394
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,210
前程无限好
The sky's the limit.

395
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,940
我俩合作很好的
Hey, we're good together.

396
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,300
这你知道的
You know that.

397
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,890
还犹豫什么
So, what's stopping us?

398
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,050
全身心投入  做自己的老板
Let's jump in with both feet, be our own bosses,

399
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,550
共建我们的未来
build our own future.

400
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,110
"做自己的老板"
"Be our own bosses."

401
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,590
哪里来的委托人呢
What about clients?

402
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,730
你刚刚签了梅萨维德银行  是吧
Mesa Verde just signed with you, didn't they?

403
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,510
想把他们挖走很难
It'll be a hard sell to take them with me.

404
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,760
那就再找一个梅萨维德
So, then there will be another Mesa Verde.

405
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,840
这全都靠你  金
That was all you, Kim.

406
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,170
你能签下这个  再签一个有何难
You did it once. You can do it again.

407
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,270
你说得轻松
You make it sound easy.

408
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,770
不  你面前的这个男人
No. You're talking to a guy

409
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,840
可是在美甲店里蜗居了多年
who lived ‭in the back of a nail salon.

410
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,430
肯定要付出很多心血和汗水
No, this is gonna be a whole lot of blood, sweat, and tears --

411
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,020
至少一开始肯定很艰难
at least, at the start.

412
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,710
但是最终我们会拥有完全属于我们的生意
But in the end, we'll have a practice that is 100% ours,

413
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,980
很值得
that's worth it.

414
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,710
也有可能失败  两手空空
Or we fail ‭and end up with nothing.

415
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,370
你说得对  这就是一场赌博
Well, you're right -- it's a gamble.

416
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,440
这是一场豪赌
It's a big one.

417
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,410
没错  但你是把赌注压在自己身上
Yeah, ‭but you're betting on yourself,

418
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,230
就我看来  你赢的几率很大
and from where I sit, the odds are in your favor.

419
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,030
你是一名出色的律师
You're an amazing lawyer.

420
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,280
这是你向世界展示的机会
This is your chance to show the world that.

421
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,880
那我为什么不去斯韦卡特呢
So, why not go to Schweikart?

422
00:24:58,890 --> 00:24:59,710
他们也会让我成为合伙人
They'll make me partner,

423
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,450
而且他们律所可靠  声誉又好
and they are a solid, respectable firm.

424
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,570
这一点无可否认
You can't deny that.

425
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,960
你不该只满足于这样的横向调动
You deserve more than just a lateral move.

426
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,340
这就是斯韦卡特代表的
Bottom line -- that's what Schweikart represents.

427
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,830
他只是另一个霍华德·哈姆林罢了
He's just Howard Hamlin by a different name.

428
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,410
你一直在说我和斯韦卡特
You keep talking about me and Schweikart.

429
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,920
那你和戴维斯梅因怎么办
What about you and Davis & Main?

430
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,270
结束了  我今天辞职了
That's over. I quit today.

431
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,970
严格来讲  是我被炒了
Well, technically, I got fired.

432
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,340
怎么了
What happened?

433
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,050
互相看不顺眼  而且由来已久
It was mutual and a long time coming.

434
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,050
这份工作从一开始就不适合我
That job was never the right fit for me.

435
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,240
这份才是
This is.

436
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,860
如果我俩要成为律所合伙人
If we're gonna be law partners,

437
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,200
有一件事我需要确认
I need to know one thing.

438
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,970
你会是什么样的律师
What kind of lawyer are you gonna be?

439
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,500
我不是指你要专攻哪一法律  我指的是
I don't mean what kind of law are you gonna practice. I mean

440
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,760
你会照章办事吗
are you gonna play it straight,

441
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,590
还是继续
or are you gonna...

442
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,950
耍各种花招
be colorful?

443
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,620
我会照章办事  绝不出格
I'm gonna play it straight, right down the line.

444
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,820
我会万分谨慎
I'm gonna dot every "I," and I'm gonna cross every...

445
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,330
如果我不能做自己  那这又有什么意义
There's no point in me doing this if I can't be myself.

446
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,130
每一次我照着别人的方法来做事
Every time I try to do things someone else's way,

447
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,350
都会把事情搞砸
it blows up in my face.

448
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,690
在戴维斯梅因律所就是如此
That's what happened at Davis & Main.

449
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,080
看看结果如何
Look how that turned out.

450
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,010
我差点毁了你的事业  惹毛了所有人
I almost derailed your career, pissed everyone off.

451
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,250
我一直都努力活在别人的期望中
I've been trying to be the person someone else wants me to be for...

452
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,180
我也不知道有多久了
I don't know how long.

453
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,820
一开始是查克
I mean, first, it was Chuck,

454
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,930
然后是你  这并不是你的错
then it was you -- ‭and that's not your fault.

455
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,210
那是我自己的选择
That was my choice.

456
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,100
但是如果我们要这么做
But if we're gonna do this,

457
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,550
我要做我自己
I got to go into it as me.

458
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,120
所以  没错
So, yeah.

459
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,530
继续耍花招吧
Colorful, I guess.

460
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,470
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

461
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,970
我只是
I just...

462
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,490
我不明白为什么我俩非要在一起工作呢
I don't see ‭why it's so important to you that we work together.

463
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,030
我们已经...
I mean, we're already...

464
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,990
你为什么还要拉我入伙呢
‭Why do you need me for this?

465
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,670
我不是需要你  我想要你
I don't need you -- I want you.

466
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,690
你已经拥有我了...
You've got me...

467
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,310
只不过不是合伙人
Just not as a law partner.

468
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,690
我得回去工作了
I have to get back to work.

469
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,010
你没事吧
You okay?

470
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,820
没事
Yeah.

471
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,750
没事  我很好
No, I'm fine.

472
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,210
去吧
Go on.

473
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,450
那一会见
See you later? ‭

474
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,050
一会见
Yeah.

475
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,350
你也看到了  这房子可以拎包入住
It's move-in ready, as you can see.

476
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,670
在过去三年里已经重新装修过了
And they've renovated within the past three years --

477
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,990
地板和厨房都是新的
new floors, new kitchen.

478
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,670
空间也很大
And it's a good amount of space.

479
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,870
这房子不算太过吧
It's not too much house, you think?

480
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,540
一点也不过分
No, not at all.

481
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,710
看看那后院啊
And look at that backyard.

482
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,820
他们把小房子都留在这了
They're leaving the playhouse.

483
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,200
是不是很棒
Isn't that amazing? ‭

484
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,390
凯莉肯定爱死了
Kaylee will go crazy for that.

485
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,410
-她肯定进去了就不想出来  -是吧
- You'll never get her outta there. - I know, right?

486
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,240
最重要的是
And the most important part --

487
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,910
周围的学校很不错  邻居也很棒
the schools are good and the neighborhood is great.

488
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,890
我打了本警区的电话  问了犯罪率
I called the local precinct and asked about the crime stats --

489
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,600
这里是市里最低的地方之一
they're some of the lowest in the city.

490
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,560
而且  他的语气很好
Plus, I got a good vibe from him.

491
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,550
听起来很负责任
Like, they sounded really responsive.

492
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,010
这很不错
That sounds perfect.

493
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,140
是的
Yeah.

498
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,260
-但是什么  -需要一大笔钱 
- But what? - ‭It's a lot of money.

499
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,810
我知道我一直唠叨  但确实要很多钱
I know -- I'm like ‭a broken record, but it is.

500
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
这你不必担心
You don't worry about that.

501
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,450
无论多少钱都要买下来
We'll make it happen, whatever the cost.

502

Not another thought.

504
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,030
你想要就买吧
If you want it, it's yours.

505
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,660

559
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,200
其实最近一起非常复杂

560
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,040
一起诉讼案  离婚不顺造成的
It was a litigation -- the result of a nasty divorce.

561
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,970
我的委托人起诉她以前的公司
My client was suing her former company,

562
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,210
她和前夫在协议书中分了该公司的财产

563
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,660
其中的问题让我研究了几周判例法
The issues involved had me chasing case law for weeks.

564

-谁审理的  -皮特曼法官

他很难缠啊
That guy -- he's a handful, huh?

他有时候是很难搞
Well, he can be a tough nut to crack,

567
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,020
但他做出了有利我的判决
but he did rule in my favor.

568
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,110
行了  别总说法律了
All right, ‭enough about law, law, law.

这大概是十年前的事了
I was there almost, ‭uh, well, 10 years ago now.

575
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,250
一步一步往上爬  很不错
Pulled yourself up by your bootstraps -- I like that.

576

I see you went to UNM law. Are you from New Mexico?

577
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,970
老家不在这
Not originally.

578
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,600
我是中西部人
I'm from the Midwest,

579
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,570
地图上都没有的小镇
Just a tiny, little town barely on the map --

580
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,480
堪萨斯和内布拉斯加交界处
You know, ‭that Kansas-Nebraska border.

581

也许...
I guess...

584
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,000
有一天  我回顾人生  回顾曾经的我
Uh, one day, ‭I just looked around at my life, at who I was,

585
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,320
我意识到  如果继续走那条路的话
and realized if I kept going the way I was going...

586
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,430
哪条路
Which way was that?

587
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:35,880
最好的情况
Best case?

588
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,870
可能是嫁给镇上开加油站的那个人
Probably married to the guy that ran the town gas station.

589
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,060
也可能是在辛奇丁奇当个收银员
Maybe cashiering down at the Hinky Dinky.

590
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,030
-辛奇什么  -辛奇丁奇

00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,490
个体律所
Solo practice.

653
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,850
怎么  你又觉得这么做不好了
‭What? You don't think it's a good idea now?

654

Good.

662

为此  我有个提议
To that end... I have a pitch for you.

663
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,930
不是韦克斯勒麦吉尔  而是韦克斯勒
Not Wexler-McGill, but Wexler...

664
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,560
以及麦吉尔
and McGill.

665
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,270
我们找间办公室  平摊物业费
We find an office, ‭share the housekeeping costs,

666
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,730
房租  电费  一切
the rent, electricity -- everything.

667
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,850
但我是律师金·韦克斯勒
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law,

668
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,910
你是律师吉米·麦吉尔
and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law,

669
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,230
我们都可以按自己意愿执业
both free to practice as we see fit.

670
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,900
同一屋檐下两间律所
Separate firms under one roof?

671
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,490
我们都要出城  为什么不拼车呢
We're both headed uptown, so why can't we share a taxi?

672
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:02,270
你按你的方式来  我按我的来
You do things your way, and I do them mine.

673
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,530
我们有自由
We'll have freedom,

674
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,270
但也不会孤军奋战
but we aren't each trying to go it alone.

675
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,600
不是合伙人  而是一起工作的个体律师
Not partners -- ‭solo practitioners, together.

676
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,990
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

677
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,460
我不知道说什么好
I don't know what to say.

678
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,010
说同意吧
Say yes.
