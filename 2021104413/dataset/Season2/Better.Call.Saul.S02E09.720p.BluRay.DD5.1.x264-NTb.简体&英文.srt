你不是说听证会只是走形式而已吗

当然可以
Certainly.

69
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,090
亚利桑那州斯科茨代尔

罗塞拉路1216号  85262

72
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,390
好  我现在看着的申请书
Okay. Because the application I'm looking at today

73
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,210
清清楚楚地写着1216号
clearly gives the address as 1216.

74
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,130
1216  是的  先生
1216 -- that's correct, sir.

75
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,510
但在你们最初提交的文件中
But in the original submission,

76
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,590
写的是罗塞拉路1261号
we're seeing 1261 Rosella Drive.

77
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,930
-是1261  -1261
- It is 1261. ‭- 1261.

78
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,920
如果你们复查一遍  就会发现应该是1216
I think if you double-check, you'll see that 1216 is correct.

79
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,510
似乎是两个不同的地址
There seem to be ‭two different addresses here.

80
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,150
专员先生  我这儿有一份意向通知书复印件
Mr. Commissioner, I have a copy of our notice of intent,

81
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,310
之前发表在亚利桑那和新墨西哥州的报纸上
which was published in newspapers in Arizona and New Mexico.

It clearly states the address is 1261 Rosella Drive.

83
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,600

是的  我这也有一份意向通知书
Yes, I have a copy of the notice of intent, too,

86
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,120
但是正式提交的文件上
but on the actual filing,

87
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,780
地址写的是1216号
the address reads 1-2-1-6.

88
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,730
所以...哪个才对
So...which is it?

89
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,210
专员先生  我能与委托人交换意见吗
Mr. Commissioner, ‭if I may confer with my clients?

90
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,580
没问题  请
Certainly, please.

91
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,350
绝对是1261号
It's absolutely 1261.

92
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,770
你搞错了
You are mistaken,

93
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,230
恕我直言  你这是在添乱
and with all due respect, you're muddying the waters here.

94
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,110
"添乱"
"Muddying the water"?

95
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,760
看
‭Look.

96
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,160
自己看
Just look.

97
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,000
这很明显是个错误
Well, ‭this is clearly an error.

98
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,390
是1261没错
It's 1261.

99
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,180
我当然知道自己的银行在哪
I know where my own damn bank is.

100
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,580
我们都冷静一下
Uh, let's just all calm down.

101
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,420
肯定可以理清楚的
I'm sure we can straighten this out.

102
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,470
我在罗塞拉路1261号改造了一栋楼
I've got a building remodel at 1261 Rosella.

103
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,350
我倒不知道1216号是哪里
I don't know where the hell 1216 is.

104
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,680
我不太明白...  1261
I-I don't quite underst-- 1261.

105
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,700
-是1261  -这有什么问题吗
- 1261. - ‭Is this gonna be a problem?

106
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,640
不会  肯定没问题
No, I'm sure it won't be.

107
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,400
专员先生  抱歉
Um, M-Mr. Commissioner, I apologize.

108
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,180
不知为何  我们的文件里
Unaccountably, there appears to be a...

109
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,550
似乎出现了矛盾
discrepancy in our filing.

110
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,110
所以正确的地址
So the correct address the one

111
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,950
是意向通知书上的1261号吗
that appeared in the notice of intent, the 1261?

112
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,230
看似如此
It would seem so.

113
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,010
我们想请求...
Uh, uh, uh, ‭we'd like to request a, um,

114
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,350
休会几分钟
an adjournment of just a few minutes

115
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,520
好让我们将文件修改为正确的地址
so that we can amend the filing to reflect the correct address.

116
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,970
我可以允许休会
Well, I-I can give you an adjournment, uh, uh,

117
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,320
但是...
but, uh...uh,

118
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,400
今天可能没办法重新听证了
I don't think we can get you back in today.

119
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,000
请问什么时候可以重新安排听证
If I may, when do you think you might be able to schedule us?

120
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,330
工作人员告知
I'm being told by staff

121
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,880
他们已经对罗塞拉路1216号进行了调查
that they've already done the research for 1216 Rosella Drive.

122
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,830
如此一来我们的人又得去新的地址
Our folks are going to have to go back to square one

123

-从头开始  -如果...

允许分行设立...

不  不  恕我直言

提交准确的文件是你们的责任
it's up to you folks to submit accurate paperwork.

128
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,130
下次最好再次核对
Maybe next time, double-check.

129
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,920
如今  最快能够重新听证的时间

我们接受失败  别再纠结了
Now we take our licks, and we move on.

154
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,470
这不仅仅是你的错
This doesn't just reflect on you --

155
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,690
律所里这么多律师和助理都疏忽了
an office full of associates and paralegals let this get by.

156
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,990

这可不是犯错
This was no mistake.

160

那到底什么意思  "用膝盖的力"
What does that even mean -- "Lift with your knees"?

167

不知道  汗流浃背的人都这么说  来吧

好人终有好报
Sometimes, the good guys win.

204
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,040
好像有些监管方面的问题
Oh, it sounds like ‭there's some regulatory issues.

205
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,740
凯文还是担心一个律师不能胜任
Kevin's still worried that one lawyer won't be able to handle it.

206
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:50,960
你可以的
You can.

207
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,000
我得请个律师助理  也许要两个
Yeah, I'm gonna have to get a paralegal, maybe two of them,

208
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,880
报酬肯定我一个人付
and I absolutely ‭will pay for it out of my end.

209
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,280
不  我俩平分报酬
No. Come on. Split it down the middle.

210
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,540
我得赶快弄个万律数据库终端
You know what? I need ‭a Westlaw terminal right away.

211
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,250
我都不知道这种事该打电话给谁
I don't even know who to call to get that done.

212

这都是高端的问题
These are high-class problems.

213
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,900
但这活儿可不小  吉米
Yeah, but it's a major piece of work, Jimmy.

214
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,380
很  很复杂
It's just -- It's -- It's -- This is major.

215
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,520
金  你可以的  好吗
Hey, Kim, you've got this, all right?

216

Breathe. Savor.

你说得对
You know what? You're right.

是欧尼
It's Ernie.

221
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,650
欧尼  什么事
Hi, Ernie. What's up?

是的  没有  佩琪刚打电话给我
Yeah, no, Paige just called me.

223
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,180
查克说了为什么
Did Chuck say why --

224
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,950
那什么时候
So, when --

225
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,440

Okay. Thanks.

227
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,290

查克说可以给我了
Chuck's ready ‭to turn them to me.

229
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,470
真的
Really?

230
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,810
好快啊
That was... quick.

231
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,480
是啊
Yeah.

232
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,750
我换个衣服就过去
Uh, I'm gonna go change and get over there.

233
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,420
-需要帮忙吗  -看情况
- You want some help? ‭- That depends.

234
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,410
你是帮着搬箱子  还是在旁边幸灾乐祸
Are you gonna carry boxes, or you gonna gloat?

235
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,780
两个都要有一点吧
Uh, some from column "A," Some from column "B."

236
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,880
放个电
Ground yourself.

237
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,360
什么
W-- Sorry?

238
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,140
就碰一下那个东西
Just touch the thing.

239
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,220
怎么回事  开不开
What the hell? This thing doesn't...

240
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,380
-吉米你好  金你好  -欧尼你好

锁出了点问题
Somethin's wrong with the lock.

242
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,040
麦吉尔让我打电话给锁匠换掉了
Mr. McGill had me call a locksmith and changed them.

243
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,140
是吗  为什么呢
Yeah? Why'd he do that?

244
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,690
查克  为什么要换锁
Hey, Chuck, why'd you change the locks?

245
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,180
欧内斯托  我这里没什么事了
Ernesto, I think we're good.

246
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,070
你肯定还要回办公室吧
I'm sure you're needed back at the office.

247
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,180
那我走了
Well... I'll get going, then.

250
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,140
那么  查克  锁怎么了
So, Chuck, ‭what's the deal with the locks?

251
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,160
金  本来这些话我想对你说
Kim, I was hoping to have this conversation with you

252
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,460
对你一个人说
and you alone.

253
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,420
但是
However...

254
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:11,180
我想现在该澄清所有事实了
I guess it's time to clear the air once and for all.

255
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,740
澄清什么事实
Clear the air about what?

256
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,640
他陷害了我
He sabotaged me.

257
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,460
兄弟  你说什么
Buddy, what are you, uh...

258
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,280
省省吧
Please. Don't bother.

259
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,960
你我都知道我要说什么
You and I both know ‭exactly what I'm talking about.

260
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,840
我不知道
I don't.

261
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,920
昨天早上是我职业生涯中最大的羞辱
Yesterday morning was the worst professional humiliation of my life.

262
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,250
一个小小的字序错误  浪费了委托人的
A single transpositional error cost my client time and money

263
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,920
钱和时间  永远破坏了我的名誉
and permanently damaged my reputation.

264
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,980
但我发现  不是错误
But then I realized... it wasn't an error.

265
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,870
根本不是
Not at all.

266
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,940
上一周的昨晚  我就睡在沙发上
A week ago last night, I was right there on that couch,

267
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,720
几乎失去了意识  吉米来了
barely consious, and Jimmy showed up.

268
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,180
支走了欧内斯托
and he sent Ernesto away.

269
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,920
我的好弟弟要亲自照顾我
My brother was gonna take care of me.

270
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,840
在夜深之时
And in the dead of night,

271
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,090
他翻了我的梅萨维德的文件
he went through my Mesa Verde files.

272
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,800
我们不用听你在这胡言乱语
Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this.

273
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,090
她得听
She does!

274
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,090
好好听  为你自己好
You do -- for your own good.

275
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,800
这里面有十三份文件
Now, in these files are 13 documents

276
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,280
标有梅萨维德银行拟设支行的地址
containing the address of Mesa Verde's proposed branch --

277
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,160
罗塞拉路1261号  亚利桑那州斯科茨代尔
1261 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, arizona.

278
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,610
吉米抽出每一份文件
Jimmy pulled each and every one,

279
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,920
留我在这里大汗淋漓神志不清
then he left me here, sweating and delirious,

280
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,670
然后跑出去篡改了它们
while he went off to doctor them.

281
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,680
你需要复印机啊
You'd need a photocopier for that.

282
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,550
你去哪了  某个通宵营业的复印店吗  
Where'd you go -- some all-night copy shop?

283
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,610
经过小心剪切和粘贴后
With a little careful cutting and pasting,

284
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,960
他做好了复制品
he created duplicates --

285
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,700
跟原件几乎一模一样
virtually identical to my originals,

286
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,750
只有一处关键差别
but with one key change --

287
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,290
罗塞拉路1261号成了罗塞拉路1216号
1261 Rosella Drive ‭became 1216 Rosella Drive.

288
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,350
这听起来可是大工程
This is sounding like a lot of work.

289
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,420
没人说你懒
No one ever accused you of being lazy --

290
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,890
你有各种缺点  唯独不懒
every other sin in the book, but not that one.

291
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,860
如果你想知道
And if you're wondering

292
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,960
吉米有没有能力伪造文书
if Jimmy's up to a little casual forgery,

293
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,700
那我告诉你
you should know in high school,

294
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,170
他高中时就曾靠伪造身份证日进斗金
he had a thriving business making fake I.Ds

295
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,610
让他的兄弟们都有啤酒喝
so his buddies could buy beer.

296
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,380
高中的事你也提吗
You going all the way back to high school, huh?

297
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,050
你跟莫扎特一样
Hey, you and Mozart, huh?

298
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,550
都是从小就有天分
You both started young.

299
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,520
他回来之后  便把复制品夹在我的文件里
He came back here and put his new versions in my files.

300
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,930
然后  第二天
And then, the next day,

301
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,030
我那体贴的弟弟就离开了
my caring brother took his leave.

302
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,300
他知道我会用他篡改过的文件
He knew that I would use his modified documents

303
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,240
撰写梅萨维德银行的申请报告
to write Mesa Verde's submission to the state regulator.

304
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,210
也确实如此  我一遍遍地
And so I did, over and over --

305
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,680
输入着1216  而不是1261
I typed "1216" instead of "1261."

306
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,280
我当时还想  "罗塞拉路1216
I remember thinking, "1216 Rosella Drive --

307
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,660
"是1215年的下一年
"that's just one year after 1215,

308
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,810
"是《大宪章》签署的第二年"
"the year the Magna Carta was signed."

309
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,290
天哪  查克  你疯了吧
Jesus, Chuck, you are unbelievable.

310
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,130
所以你的意思是  里面这些文件
So, you're saying, if we look in here,

311
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,880
上面的地址都是错误的
all the addresses will be wrong?

312
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,530
你当然不会留下证据
Well, of course you weren't gonna leave evidence behind.

313
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,520
我猜昨天早上  你等到我走了之后
I'm guessing yesterday morning, you waited until I left,

314
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,930
用你的钥匙进了门
then used your key to let yourself in

315
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,440
把原始文件还了回来
and return the originals.

316
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,180
没有掩盖的犯罪是不完整的
No crime is complete without the cover-up.

317
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,030
天哪拜托
Oh, come on.

318
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,060
我为什么要这么做  为了什么生意吗
I did all this -- what -- for some business?

319
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,340
他都是为了你
He did it for you.

320
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,370
你对此肯定一点都不知情
Oh, I'm sure you didn't know anything about it.

321
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,830
这肯定是他自己的主意
I believe he went off on his own

322
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,530
把这当成某种扭曲的浪漫之举
and did this as some kind of twisted romantic gesture.

323
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,900
查克  你应该躺下来
Chuck, ‭I think you need to lie down

324
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,800
用冷毛巾敷敷额头了
with a cold washcloth on your head.

325
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,880
现在你知道了  你别无选择了
And now that you know, you have no choice.

326
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,730
这事关委托人  一个被欺骗的委托人
This is about a client -- a client who has been defrauded.

327
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,900
作为一名宣过誓的律师
As a sworn officer of the court,

328
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,970
作为梅萨维德银行的正式代理律师
as Mesa Verde's attorney of record,

329
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,880
你只能去找凯文·沃弛泰尔
you have no recourse but to go to Kevin Wachtell

330
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,220
把这一切和盘托出
and make a full disclosure.

331
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,760
他这一整套说辞
This -- This whole song and dance --

332
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,700
只是为了夺回他的委托人
it's all about getting his client back.

333
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,190
-就是为了这个目的  -完全不是
- That's all this is. - ‭Not in the least.

334
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,870
如果他们得知真相后仍然决定...
If, knowing the truth, they still decide to go --

335
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,220
你不能忍受他们选择了她而不是你
You can't stand the fact that they chose her over you.

336
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,320
我不能忍受的是
I can't stand the fact

337
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,590
我的亲弟弟在我背后捅刀子
that my own brother stabbed me in the back!

338
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,100
我不能忍受你欺骗了这位年轻的女士
I can't stand the fact that you've deceived

339
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,980
-让她堕落至此  -"堕落"
- and ruined this fine young woman! - ‭"Ruined"?

340
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,640
现在是十九世纪四十年代吗
What is this -- the 1840s?

341
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,730
你说什么呢  她才没有堕落
What are you talking about? She's not ruined!

342
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,640
吉米
Jimmy.

343
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,620
如果你说的都是真的
If what you're saying is true,

344
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,760
吉米会被指控伪造文书  诈骗
Jimmy could be charged with forgery, fraud,

345
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
伪造证据  甚至非法侵入
falsifying evidence, even breaking and entering.

346
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,790
坦白说  我也很难受
Frankly, I am sick about this.

347
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,860
但事实就是事实
But facts are facts.

348
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,980
你有证据吗
And what is your evidence?

349
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,420
证据
My evidence?

350
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,040
证据就是我十分了解我的弟弟
My evidence is knowing my brother for his entire life.

351
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,320
查克  还有别的解释
Chuck, I think ‭there is another explanation --

352
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,530
一个更简单的解释
it's a simpler one.

353
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,660
你看错了
You made a mistake.

354
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,930
我没有
I did not.

355
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,560
你在油灯下工作
You're wororking by lantern,

356
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,130
眯着眼盯着那些打印出来的十磅小字
squinting over 10-point type for hour after hour.

357
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,250
错把1261当成了1216
Mistakenly changing 1261 to 1216

358
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,630
这是极其正常的事情
would be the most natural thing in the world.

359
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,700
我也可能犯这样的错
It could certainly happen to me.

360
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,780
我没有搞错
I did not make a mistake!

361
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,280
就是你搞错了
I believe you did.

362
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,610
我知道  你很喜欢吉米
Look, I understand that you have a -- a great affection for Jimmy.

363
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,870
很多人都喜欢  但请你睁开眼睛
A great many people do, but please open your eyes here!

364
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,100
你犯了一个错误  你非但不去面对它
You made a mistake, and instead of just facing up to it,

365
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,670
反而指责你的弟弟陷害你
you accuse your brother of plotting against you.

366
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,740
编造出这么精心策划的阴谋
You come up ‭with this elaborate scheme.

367
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,860
他做得出来
He's capable of this!

368
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,620
我知道他能
You know he is!

369
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,940
我知道他有很多缺点
I know he's not perfect!

370
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,290
我知道他喜欢走捷径
And I know he cuts corners.

371
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,300
但是你让他变成这样的
But you're the one who made him this way.

372
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,280
他崇拜你
He idolizes you.

373
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,180
他接受你
He accepts you.

374
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,650
他照顾你
He takes care of you.

375
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,710
他只想要你的爱与支持
And all he ever wanted was your love and support,

376
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,200
但你只会对他指手画脚
but all you've ever done is judge him.

377
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,600
你从来不相信他
You never believed in him.

378
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,450
你从来不希望他成功
You never wanted him to succeed.

379
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,600
你知道吗
And you know what?

380
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,160
我为他感到难过
I feel sorry for him.

381
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,920
也为你感到难过
And I feel sorry for you.

382
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,870
天啊  干什么
Jesus! What? ‭

383
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,820
金  干什么
Kim! What?

384
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,820
给我  开车
Just drive.

385
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,200
好了  根据班级排好队
All right, line up by class!

386
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,130
去找你们的小伙伴
Find your buddy!

387
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,430
孩子们  过来
Okay, kids, come on.

388
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,230
我们上
Let's go.

389
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,760
来  来
Come on. Come on.

390
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,590
-各就各位  -这边吗
- Plant yourself. ‭- All right. Here?

391
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,040
没错  这边
Yeah. Right there.

392
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,560
这么高就行了
About yea high. ‭

393
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,870
对准我  拍出英雄气概
Aim it up at me -- heroic.

394
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,190
英雄气概  祝你好运了
Heroic? Good luck with that.

395
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,860
赶紧给我拍
Just frame me up, all right?

396
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,220
把脖子也给化好
Make sure you get the neck, okay?

397
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,580
-这是从下方拍摄的  -好的
- It's a low-angle shoot. ‭- Okay.

398
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,890
算了  让我看看
Hey, you know what? Let me see.

399
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,260
这只是打个底
Oh, I-it's just base.

400
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,000
我这是得肺痨要死了吗
What -- am I dying of consumption?

401
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,550
你这个年龄段的人没那么红润
Well, at your age, ‭you don't want to look too red.

402
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,590
-应该有点红斑痤疮  -那这些...
- It looks like rosacea. - And what's with all the...

403
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,480
我只是想化出你下巴的轮廓
I'm just trying to make it look like you have a jawline.

404
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,990
我下巴本来就有轮廓
I do have a jawline.

405
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,990
这样吧  你站过去
You know what? You stand in for me.

406
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,240
蹲一点
Hey, crouch down.

407
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,370
往左  另一边
Okay. Move to your left. The other left.

408
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,450
再左一点  好了
More. More. Okay, boom!

409
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,410
就这样  懂了吧
That's what I'm talkinin about. You got it.

410
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,270
肯定还有更简单的拍摄方式
Oh, dude, there's got to be an easier way to get this shot.

411
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,300
免费的可没有
Not for free.

412
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,440
你要想拍电影  就得胆子大
You wanna be a filmmaker, grow a pair.

413
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,380
好了  准备正式拍摄
Here we go. Picture's up.

414
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,820
好  我们开始吧
All right, let's do this.

415
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,030
最后补一下
Last looks.

416
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,940
大黄  大黄  九点钟方向
Rhubarb, Rhubarb. 9:00.

417
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,430
不好意思
Excuse me.

418
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,890
你是这里的负责人吗
Hi. Are you in charge here?

419
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,020
是的  这是学校用地
Yes, I am, ‭and this is school property.

420
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,760
我正要找你呢
You're just the person I want to speak to.

421
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,060
如果你能让那幢楼里的孩子小声点
It would be incredibly helpful if you could get those kids in that building

422
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,040
会对我们很有帮助的
over there to just keep it down for a bit.

423
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,790
让他们做点练习之类的
Just give 'em a worksheet or something?

424
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,590
只要两三分钟  很快的
I mean, just two or three minutes, just for sound.

425
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,050
这里是学校用地
This is school property,

426
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,820
未经允许任何人都不得入内
and no one is allowed here without permission.

427
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,860
当然了
Of course not.

428
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,950
-安奈特没和你说吗  -安奈特是谁
- You didn't speak to Annette? - ‭Annette?

429
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,150
主管办公室的
In the Superintendent's office.

430
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,300
你认识城里叫安奈特的吗
Do you know an Annette downtown?

431
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,410
不认识
I don't think so.

432
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,290
抱歉添麻烦了
Well, I'm sorry about the mix-up.

433
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,260
我们在拍"定场镜头"
We're shooting what's called an establishing shot --

434
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,110
最多五分钟
five minutes, tops.

435
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,310
我弄清楚之前
You're not shooting anything

436
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,110
你们什么都不准拍
until I'm clear on what's going on here.

437
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,340
纪录片  我们在拍纪录片
The documentary -- we're making a documentary.

438
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,390
是...
That's -- Oh!

439
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,080
我听说有个展览或者纪念牌匾之类的
I was told there was a display or a plaque of some kind.

440
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,280
你知道在哪里吗
Would you know where that would be?

441
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,780
我们为什么会有牌匾
Why would we have a plaque?

442
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,140
因为曾在这里上过学的人
Because of who went to school here.

443
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,600
谁曾在这里上过学
Who went to school here?

444
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,210
鲁伯特·霍姆斯
Rupert Holmes.

445
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,140
就是关于他的纪录片
That's who the documentary is about.

446
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,490
抱歉  谁
I'm sorry. Who?

447
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,670
鲁伯特·霍姆斯
Rupert Holmes.

"椰林飘香之歌"

450
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,390
一种鸡尾酒

451

你肯定知道  我...

452

00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,460
如果你不喜欢瑜伽  还算有点脑子*

如果你喜欢半夜啪啪啪*

455
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,860
在海角旁的沙丘*

456

知道吗  鲁...  看看她的脸
See? Ru-- Look at her face.

457
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,490
-鲁伯特·霍姆斯  -他在这上过学吗
- Rupert Holmes. - ‭He went to school here?

458
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,570
是啊  64届的
Yeah. Class of '64.

459
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,720
他现在还经常说
He still talks about it.

460
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,480
但这所学校是71年建的
But the school was built in '71.

461
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,480
他在那之前的老楼里上过学
Mm. He was a student in the old building that used to be here.

462
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,010
我们有点...怎么说呢
We're taking a little -- what do you call it?

463
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,510
艺术再创作
Artistic liberties.

464
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,650
鲁伯特·霍姆斯不是英国人吗
Isn't Rupert Holmes English?

465
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,380
是啊  这可以拿来做小趣事
Well, yeah, ‭and that's some great trivia,

466
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,810
但他青少年时期是在阿尔布开克度过的
but he spent his formative years right here in Albuquerque.

467
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,300
这样吧  你打到主管办公室
I'll tell you what -- why don't you call Annette

468
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,820
找安奈特
down in ‭the Superintendent's Office?

469
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,400
我们就在这等官方回话
And we'll just stay here till you get official word.

470
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,870
-好  如果你不介意等的话  -不会
- Well, ‭if you don't mind waiting. - Not at all.

我们不想违反任何规定
We don't want to break any rules.

472
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,820
不会太久的
Shouldn't take very long, I'm sure.

473
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,120
虽然不能保证
And no promises,

474
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,140
但我尽量让孩子们安静点
but I'll see what I can do about getting the kids to quiet down.

475
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,890
那真是帮了大忙了
Oh. ‭That would be super helpful.

476
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,210
快点  这时候正好
Chop-chop. Magic time.

477
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,700
-快点  -好的
- Come on, let's go. - All right

478
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,210
不做造型了  把旗子降下来
No last looks. ‭Just the flag -- the flag.

479
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,220
好  记着  英雄气概
Okay, remember -- heroic.

Was there ever anything good in the paper?

确实不多
Not too often.

我问一下
I got to ask...

498

这里下过雪吗
does it ever snow around here?

499
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,190
下过
Sure, it does.

500
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,910
你要在阿尔布开克度过第一个冬天吗
This is gonna be your first winter in Albuquerque?

501

没错  我从费城来
Yeah. I'm out from Philadelphia.

502
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,770
看年份吧
Well, it depends on the year.

503
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,020
如果你待得够久
If you stay around long enough,

504
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,090
就会有雪铲的  不用担心
you'll have something to shovel -- don't you worry.

505
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,400
我喜欢铲雪
That suits me.

506
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,580
我住在锡达克雷斯特  经常下雪
I live up in Cedar Crest. We get plenty.

507
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,320
如果嫌不够可以来铲我家车道的雪
You can shovel my drive if you're looking for more.

508
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,160
一句话的事
Just say the word.

509
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,730
好吧
Yeah, well...

510
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,390
小姐  结账
Miss. check, please?

511
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,340
喂
Yeah.

512
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,640
我们得谈谈
We gotta talk.

513
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,820
我得知道些事
I've got something I need to know,

514
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,130
立刻告诉我
and I need to know it fast.

515
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,080
什么事
What's that?

516
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,090
我们不久前被抢了
We got hit the other day.

517
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,970
一辆向南开的卡车被劫了
A truck headed south got hijacked.

518
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,020
有人偷了二十五万
Someone stole a quarter million.

519
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,430
现在赫克托气疯了  在找是谁干的
Now Hector's flippin' out, lookin' for who did it.

520
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,910
问题是
Thing is...

521
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,060
我觉得是你
I think it was you.

522
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,370
司机被绑起来了  身上却没有伤痕
They left the driver hog-tied -- not a mark on him.

523
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,490
干这一行的都杀人不眨眼
Anyone in the game would capped him without a second thought.

524
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,810
但这个司机还活着
But this driver? He's still breathin'.

525
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,440
我就琢磨  这家伙是谁
I thought to myself, "who's the guy

526
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,940
抢了几十万毒资
who'll rip off a couple hundred thousand

527
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,940
还留一个目击者
in drug money and leave a witness?

528
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,400
什么人不愿开枪
Who's the guy ‭who won't pull the trigger?"

529
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,520
你
You.

530
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,160
我不是来勒索你的
I'm not here to squeeze you.

531
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,510
你想抢贩毒集团  那是你的事
You wanna rip off the cartel, that's your business.

532
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,610
但问题是
But here's the thing.

533
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,500
我要去接那个司机  赫克托的命令
I'm picking up that driver -- Hector's orders.

534
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,170
我们要看看他知道什么
We're gonna see what he knows,

535
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,200
如果他认出了你  对我俩都不好
and if he knows you, that's bad for both of us.

536
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,770
你不用担心
That shouldn't concern you.

537
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,520
但他跟你是一伙的  对吧
But he was in on it, right?

538
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,990
那司机和此事无关
The driver ‭had nothing to do with it.

539
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,750
-那是谁  -只有我
- Then who? - ‭Just me.

540
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,730
你是说你干这票  里头没人吗
You're telling me you did this without someone on the inside?

541
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,560
不可能
Not possible.

542
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,150
你怎么知道那辆卡车的
How did you know about the truck?

543
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,330
你怎么知道在轮胎里
How do you know about the tires?

544
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,370
要我说
All I can tell you is,

545
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,050
你们高估了自己的智商
you guys aren't half as smart as you think you are.

546
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,880
所以那个司机什么都不知道吗
So the driver... doesn't know anything?

547
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,090
-什么都不知道  -他听到你声音了吗
- Not a thing. - ‭He hear your voice?

548
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,960
-没有  -现在赫克托还在查竞争对手
- No. - ‭Right now, Hector's looking at the competition,

549
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,990
但他要是听司机说是个年纪大的美国佬...
but he hears the driver say it was some old gringo...

550
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,140
他没听到我说话
He didn't hear me.

551
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,940
他就看到一个戴滑雪面具的人而已
He saw a guy with a ski mask -- that's it.

552
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,300
你肯定
And you're sure of that?

553
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,910
没错
Yeah.

554
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,640
你最好别搞错
You better be right.

555
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,040
为什么没上报纸
Why wasn't it in the papers?

556
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,630
什么
What?

557
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,290
卡车劫案  警察没让上报纸吗
The truck robbery -- the cops keeping it out of the papers?

558
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,740
警察
The cops?

559
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,720
警察什么都不知道
The cops don't know shit about it.

560
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,750
怎么会呢
How's that?

561
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,870
这就是你的目的吗
Is that what this is about?

562
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,740
你想让警察去抓赫克托
You wanted to put the cops onto Hector?

563
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,820
为什么
Why?

564
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,340
你对他不重要
You are nothing to him.

565
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,040
他完全忘了你
He forgot all about you.

566
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,450
我可没忘记他
I haven't forgotten him.

567
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,210
你把我推进火坑
You put me in the shit,

568
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,680
就因为你想整赫克托·塞拉曼加
just 'cause you got it in for Hector Salamanca?

569
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,700
你把警察引向了他  也就引向了我
Listen, you put the cops on him, you put them on me.

570
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,640
你要是为了钱  我懂  但你这样
Doing it for the money -- I get it, but this shit --

571
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,410
真是疯了
that's insane.

572
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,830
你得冷静
You need to calm yourself down,

573
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,670
把手从口袋里拿出来
and you need to take that hand out of that pocket.

574
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,380
你要明白
Now, just so you know...

575
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,900
都结束了
it's over.

576
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,650
我跟你老板的事结束了
I'm done with your boss.

577
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,710
算了
Whatever.

578
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,260
为什么没上报纸
Why wasn't it in the papers?

579
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,030
因为我们收拾干净了
Because we cleaned it up.

580
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,660
怎么收拾的
How's that?

581
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,830
我们很幸运
We got lucky.

582
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,040
你离开后  有个好心人过来
After you left, ‭a Good Samaritan came along

583
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,650
大叫"天啊  天啊"
and said, "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"

584
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,550
他给司机松绑  司机叫我们过去
He cut the driver loose. The driver called us.

585
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,210
我们过去开走了卡车
We came out, got the truck.

586
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,210
就好像没发生过一样
Made it like it never happened.

587
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,460
那好心人呢
And that Good Samaritan?

588
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,950
赫克托崩了他的脸
Hector shot him in the face.

589
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,970
我们把他埋在了沙漠里
We buried the guy out in the desert.

590
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,580
我说了...
Like I said...

591
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,260
我们收拾干净了
we cleaned it up.

592
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,270
你今天怎么样
How was your day?

593
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,420
跟佩奇和凯文见面
You know, met with Paige and Kevin,

594
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,660
面试了些律师助理
interviewed some paralegals...

595
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,120
还有这个
and, uh, this.

596
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,130
你呢
What about you? ‭

597
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,270
拍完了广告
Finished the commercial.

598
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,170
我不是卖弄  但这可能是
I don't want to oversell it, but I think it might be

599
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,390
电视史上最棒的六十秒
the greatest 60 seconds in the history of television.

600
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,620

我认识的最聪明的  无意冒犯你
The smartest one I know -- I mean, no offense.

615
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,570
他会是强劲的对手
He'd make quite an adversary.

616
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,860
你说得没错
You'd better believe it.

617
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,660
他是那种
The kind of adversary

618
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,620
会发现你辩词中最细微漏洞的对手
who'd find even the smallest crack in your defense.

619
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,400
和他对抗  你真得确保
Going against him, you'd really want to make sure

620
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,170
你做得滴水不漏

不记得
Uh...no.

627
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,870
我觉得你应该记得  兰斯
I got a weird feeling you do, Lance.

628
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,370
今晚很有趣
Tonight is a funny night.

我感觉自己得到了全部答案
I feel like I've got all the answers...

631

感觉就好像
I'm feeling kind of like, uh...

632
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,330
卡纳克一样
like Carnac.

633
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,850
约翰尼·卡尔森在《约翰尼·卡尔森今夜秀》中出演的角色

634
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,850
你记得约翰尼·卡尔森过去演卡纳克吗
Do you remember when Johnny Carson used to do Carnac?

635
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,010
他会在问题提出前给出答案
You know, he'd give the answers before the questions.

636
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,300
埃德会给他信封  是吧
You know, Ed would give him the envelope, yeah?

637
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,480
约翰尼会将它顶住前额
And Johnny would hold it up to his forehead,

638
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,710
然后给出答案  比如
and, um, he'd give the answer, like,

639
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,030
"留给河狸"
"Leave It to Beaver."

640
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,030
上世纪五六十年代美国电视剧

641
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,870
然后约翰尼会打开信封
Then Johnny'd tear open the envelope.

642
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,450
问题是
And there's the question --

643
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,700
"浣熊的遗嘱里写了什么"
"What did the dead raccoon say in his will?"

644
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,720
想起来了吗
That ring a bell?

645
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,900
你那时没出生吗
Before your time?

646
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,830
我们言归正传
All right, well, let's cut to the chase.

647
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,850
刚走出这里的男人
Um, that guy ‭who just walked out of here --

648
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,170
名叫欧尼
his name is Ernie.

649
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,060
他给你看了我的照片吧
I'm guessing he showed you my picture

650
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,330
还问你我那晚来过这没有
and asked if ‭I was in here the other night.

651
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,510
他现在会带他老板来  也就是我哥哥
Now he's going to bring his boss, who's my brother,

652
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,570
他会问你同样的问题
and he's gonna ask you the same question --

653
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,360
"你那晚见过那人吗"
"Did you see that guy the other night?"

654
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,450
答案是没有
Well, the answer is no.

655
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,940
懂了吗
You feel me?

656
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,240
你杀人了吗
You murder someone?

657
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,600
没有
Nope.

658
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,100
抢银行了
Rob a bank?

659
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,630
我没那么厉害
No way am I that cool.

660
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,270
我有时候上大号不冲厕所  但...
I -- sometimes, I go number two and I don't flush, but...

661
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:08,360
这是兄弟间的事
this is just a thing between brothers.

662
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,580
而且我们都是律师  所以...
And we're both lawyers, so...

663
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,900
那是个冗长又无聊的故事
Right? I mean, ‭that's a long and boring story.

664
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,210
你没兴趣的
You don't wanna know.

665
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:21,800
这件事会惹来警察吗
Is this gonna get me jammed up with the cops?

666
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:27,190
我哥哥也许会跟你这么说  但是不会
My brotherer may make it sound like that, but...no.

667
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,680
家事而已
It's just family.

668
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,210
那我明白了
Then I feel you.

669
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,740
跟我说说摄像头怎么回事
Hey, ‭tell me about the cameras.

670
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:45,220
后面有台录像机
Oh. Uh, they go to a VCR in the back.

671
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,500
每录十二小时就回过头重录一遍
It, uh, tapes for 12 hours and then records over itself.

672
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,070
所以我现在被录上吗
Right. So I'm on there now?

673
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,070
要抹掉记录有多困难
How hard would it be to erase?

674
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,460
我不确定
Mm. I don't know.

675
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,590
可能很麻烦...
Could be tricky...

676
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,000
而且很贵
and expensive.

677
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,600
像一百块那么贵
Like 100 bucks expensive?

678

两百块那么贵
Like 200 bucks expensive.

679
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:12,510

那个人给我看照片的时候
