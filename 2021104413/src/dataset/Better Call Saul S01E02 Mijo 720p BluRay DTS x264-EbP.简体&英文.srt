00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,740
{\an8}{\pos(192,225)}请您回楼上去吧

153
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,580
{\an8}{\pos(192,225)}好  可我不想让它干了

154
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,120
{\an8}{\pos(192,225)}如果干了  就擦不掉了

155
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,530
说吧
Talk.

156
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,640
让我有根据地推测一下这儿发生的事
I'm gonna make an educated guess what happened here.

157
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,130
我的两名委托人
My two clients,

158
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,720
弗里克和弗拉克  两个"拖把头"
Frick and Frack, the mopheads,

159
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,400
遇到了一点交通事故  有点轻微的磕碰
were in a simple traffic accident, a minor fender bender,

160
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,410
但可能是他们站错了地方
but maybe they were on the wrong side of the street,

161
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,680
也可能是没有看马路两边
or they didn't look both ways.

162
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,770
谁都有可能
It could happen to anyone.

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,040
我的委托人展示出了极差的判断力
My clients, exhibiting extremely poor judgment,

164
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,840
居然一路跟着您奶奶
uh, followed your grandmother

165
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,010
到了这间温馨别致的房子
to this delightful, well-tended home.

166
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,500
而现在  我推测
Now, at this juncture, I'm deducing

167
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,770
他们说了或做了一些过分的事
that they said or did something that...crossed a line,

168
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,770
而您自有您的道理
And you, with some justification --

169
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,780
教训了他们一番
you put them in their place.

170
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,930
根据这辣茄酱污渍  他俩的下场可能有几种
Based on the salsa stain there, could have gone a couple ways.

171
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,730
底线是...不是说来恶心你
The bottom line -- not to be morbid,

172
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,520
但如果他们死了  我猜我...
but if they're dead, um, I'm guessing that I'm...

173
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,890
我应该...  应该...
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna -- yeah, I'm gonna go

174
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,080
积极乐观地离开  就当他们没来过
with glass half full here and say they're not.

175
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,820
我是说  如果他们还活着
Uh, my point is, if they're still alive,

176
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,180
何必杀我们呢  何必呢
why kill us? Why?

177
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,440
就因为一点误会  或者因为我们太蠢
Because of a misunderstanding? Our own stupidity?

178
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,300
何必把你奶奶漂亮的房子弄脏呢
Why mess up your lovely abuelita's place?

179
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,880
为什么不直接说最核心的部分
Why jump to the nuclear option?

180
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,890
我的意思是让事情简单一些
See, I'm saying keep it simple.

181
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,940
我会带上我愚蠢的委托人
I will collect my moronic clients, and --

182
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,750
然后立刻消失
poof! -- We are gone.

183
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,860
你和你可爱的奶奶
Neither you nor your lovely abuelita

184
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,500
永远都不会再见到我们  我保证
will ever lay eyes on us ever again, guaranteed,

185
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,480
签字盖章并交付[指一文件作成]
signed, sealed, and delivered.

186
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,450
假设  他们还活着的话
Assuming, you know, that they're still breathing.

187
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,940
你口才不错啊
You got a mouth on you.

188
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,750
谢谢你
Thank you.

189
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,290
起来
Get up.

190
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,840
那边
That way.

191
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,640
那边吗  好的  这就去
That way. Y-yeah, sure. Why not?

192
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,480
怎么  我来给他们松绑吗
So, what -- I should cut 'em loose?

193
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,180
都是他  都是他的主意
It was him! It was all his idea!

194
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,870
不不不
No, no, no!

195
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,060
你闭嘴
You shut up!

196
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,390
你说什么
Say what?

197
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,920
他想敲诈你
He -- he wanted to scam you.

198
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,520
他说我们能轻易骗到两千块
He said we could clear 2 grand, easy.

199
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,010
你敲诈我吗
You punking me?

200
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,180
你想敲诈我的奶奶吗
Are you punking my abuelita?

201
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,070
他撞到了头
He hit his head.

202
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,720
他根本不知道自己在说什么
He doesn't know what he's saying.

203
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,700
为了什么
For what?

204
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,150
为什么你会得到两千块
For what are you getting 2 grand?

205
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,360
只要跟踪你的奶奶
It was for going after your grandma,

206
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,070
在她的车前摔一跤然后要挟她
just for taking a header over her car and then b-bracing her.

207
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,010
都是他的主意  我发誓  是这个律师
It was him, I swear! It was the lawyer!

208
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,650
你是谁  为什么要跟着我
Who are you?! Why are you after me?!

209
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,860
我能解释的  你一定会笑的
I can explain. It's -- you're gonna laugh.

210
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,830
我是个律师  你可以看我的身份证  好吗
It's so -- I'm a lawyer. I -- check my I.D., okay?

211
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,310
但我在行骗
But I was running a scam.

212
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,230
-骗我的奶奶吗  -不不
- On my abuelita?! - No, no!

213
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,430
不是针对你奶奶  也不是你
Not on your abuelita, not on you.

214
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,900
有个叫贝茜·凯特尔曼的女人
There's a woman named Betsy Kettleman.

215
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,980
我提到了她
I mentioned her.

216
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,340
她嫁给了克雷格·凯特尔曼
She's married to Craig Kettleman.

217
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,190
他是伯纳利欧县的财务主管
He's the treasurer of Bernalillo County.

218
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,800
我想做他的生意  因为
I wanted his business 'cause...

219
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,030
他从县里挪用了一百五十万
he stole a million and a half bucks from the county.

220
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,210
从现在起他可能随时被指控挪用公款
He's gonna be indicted for embezzlement any day now.

221
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,670
对我来说这是个好案子  很大曝光率
This is a good case for me -- a lot of publicity.

222
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,560
我可以借此扬名
I'll get my name out, and...

223
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,830
不管怎样  我以为如果我让这两个人
Anyway, I thought if I had these two

224
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,460
滑着小滑板敲诈凯特尔曼太太
run their little skateboard hustle on Mrs. Kettleman,

225
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,390
而我可以拯救她
I could, you know, rescue her.

226
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,560
过来平息风波
Come in, throw some oil on troubled waters,

227
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,030
我就能得到他们的委托
and, yeah, I'd get their business.

228
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,620
这就是全部计划
That was the plan.

229
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,230
但事实是你可爱的奶奶
But it turns out your lovely abuelita --

230
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,390
她开的车
she drives a car...

231
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,630
非常像凯特尔曼家里的车
...that's a whole lot like the Kettle-mobile.

232
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,490
所以这两个天才敲诈错了人
So, these two geniuses ran their little stunt on the wrong one.

233
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,280
所以是我倒蚀把米
So, joke's on me.

234
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,450
就这么简单
I -- simple as that.

235
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,670
他去哪儿
Where's he going?

236
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,390
跟我说说  好吗
Talk to me, okay?

237
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,900
你以为我是谁  他在拿什么东西
Who do you think I am? What is he getting?

238
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,050
我行骗为了得到客户
I was running a scam to get a client.

239
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,210
我犯了个错误  就这些了
I made a mistake. That's all this is.

240
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,130
天哪
Oh, geez.

241
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,750
你不需要
Y-you don't need...

242
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,470
这不是...我会说的  好吗
That's not... I'll talk, okay?

243
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,050
告诉我你想知道什么
Tell me what you want to know!

244
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,870
你觉得  你觉得我是谁啊
Who do -- who do you think I am?

245
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,000
动口不动手好吗
Hey, use your words, okay?

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,030
干嘛
What?

247
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,260
你知道我闻到了什么吗
You know what I smell?

248
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,850
我闻到了谎言的气味
I smell lies.

249
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,240
我闻到了猪肉的味道
I smell pork.

250
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,710
不  不要这样
No, that's not necessary.

251
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,460
我们知道你是跟警察一伙  问题是哪个警方
Okay, we know you're with the heat. The question is, who?

252
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,520
-本地警方还是联调局  -都不是
- Local? FBI? - No, no, no.

253
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,080
-还是禁毒署  -我是个律师
- D.E.A.?! - No, I'm a lawyer.

254
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,880
去我的衣服口袋里翻  就在那里
Just reach in my pocket right now -- right there!

255
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,260
说实话
Truth.

256
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,740
那就是实话
That is the truth!

257
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,770
我是律师  我通过了司法考试  随便问
I'm a lawyer! Guys, I passed the bar! Ask me anything!

258
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,810
别问合同法就行  我每天都会到法庭去
Not contract law, okay? I'm down at the courts every day!

259
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,000
那些人都认识我
People know me!

260
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,360
我是那里的熟脸  真的
I'm a known quantity -- I am!

I'm -- I'm special agent Jeffrey Steele, FBI.

262
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,190

263
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,040
我是卧底  知道吗  被你发现了
I'm undercover, okay? You got me.

264
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,020
我是重要人物
I'm the tip of the spear,

265
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,660
释放我才是明智之举
and releasing me would be the smart move.

266
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,230
听见了吗
You hear that shit?

267
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,490
我跟你说了这桩买卖好得有点离奇
I told you the business was too good.

268
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,410
我就知道  我告诉过你
I knew it. I told you.

269
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,680

274
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,340
为了什么  我们做了什么
For what? What did we do?

我们在局里就是这么叫的
That's what we call them down at the bureau.

279
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,070
特遣队的代号是
It's -- the task force

280
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,130
"打倒国王行动"
is designated "Operation King Breaker."

281
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,440
-"打倒国王"  -所以...
- "King Breaker"? - So...

282
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,080
这么说我是国王了
That makes me the king!

283
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,870
我来吧
Can I?

284
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,970
行了
All right.

285
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,960
从你嘴里吐出的下一个字必须是真话
The next words out of your mouth got to be the truth.

286
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,980
听明白了吗
You understand?

287
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,750
你是谁
Who are you?

288
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,220
我是詹姆斯·摩根·麦吉尔  我是律师
I'm James Morgan Mcgill. I'm a lawyer.

289
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,360
我是为了开拓业务  这是真的
I was trolling for business, okay? That's the truth.

290
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,810
你去找本圣经来  我会对它发誓的
Now, you find a bible, I'll swear on it.

291
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,360
"打倒国王行动"  联调局  是怎么回事
Okay, what about, uh, Operation, uh, King Breaker, FBI?

292
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,910
是我编的  对不起  对不起
I made it up, okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

293
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,730
我不认识你  也不想认识
I don't know you. I don't want to.

294
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,570
这就是个错误  是我的错  行吗
Uh, this was a mistake, oka-- it's my mistake, okay?

295
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,900
我负全责
I take full and complete responsibility,

296
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,370
不过我真的不认识你们任何人
but I don't know any of your names,

297
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,600
而且我有严重的脸盲症
and I got a bad case of face-blindness.

298
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,090
你放了我们  我们会忘记今天发生的事
You let us go, we're gonna forget this happened.

299
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,110
伙计们  我们会忘记  是不是
Guys, we're gonna forget, right?

300
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,260
快点头
Nod your heads.

301
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,780
行了吗
Okay?

302
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,210
只要你们放我们走...
So, if you just let us go and just --

303
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,110
我们只想回家
We want to just go... home.

304
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,210
给他们松绑吧
I say cut 'em loose.

305
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,770
他说他是联调局的  他都承认了
He said he was FBI. He admitted it.

306
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,760
当时你用剪钳威胁他
You had your wire cutters on him.

307
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,240
他可能是随便编出来的
He would have said anything.

308
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,910
联调局的人会雇那两个火柴棍吗
You really see the FBI hiring those two flaquitos?

309
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,990
可能是吧
Maybe.

310
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,520
无缘无故杀死一名律师得不到任何好处
Croaking a lawyer for no reason is bad business.

311
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,150
如果他失踪了  会有人来找他的
He goes away, someone's gonna come look for him.

312
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,730
他们闯进了我的房子
They walked into my house.

313
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,260
他们对我奶奶不敬
They disrespected my abuelita.

314
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,750
他们叫她"婊子"
They call her "Biznatch"!

315
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,370
就这么放他们走吗
And they just walk?!

316
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,790
那个律师怎么办
What about the lawyer?

317
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,910
他很尊重你
He's giving respect.

318
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,030
好吧
Okay.

319
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,140
"詹姆斯·M·麦吉尔
"James M. Mcgill.

320
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,890
你可以信赖的律师"
A lawyer you can trust."

321
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,050
我知道去哪找你  詹姆斯·麦吉尔
I know how to find you, James Mcgill.

322
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,250
听明白我的话了吗
Understand what I'm saying?

323
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,170
明白
Yeah.

324
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,340
起来
Up.

325
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,890
好了吗
Okay?

326
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,750
带他回自己的车上
Take him back to his car.

327
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,450
谢谢你
Thank you.

328
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,540
这是明智之举
Uh, uh, this is -- this is good.

329
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,340
-这是正确的选择  谢谢你  -走吧
- This -- this is right. Thank you. - Come on.

330
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,220
那...那他们怎么办
What -- what -- what about them?

331
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,160
-走吧  -哦对
- Come on. - Yeah, right.

332
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,720
-走吧  -好吧
- Come on. - Uh, yeah, right.

333
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,100
你要去哪
Yo, where you going?

334
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,530
等等  我能说一句吗
Uh, wait. Can I -- can I say something?

335
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,190
-你去哪  -你能放了他们吗
- Where you going? - Can you let them go?

336
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,710
-放了他们吧  -你脑袋不好使吗
- Just let them go. - Are you stupid?

337
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,990
他们罪不至死  是我指使他们的
They don't deserve to die. I put them up to it.

338
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,080
我罪不至死  他们也是
I don't deserve to die, but they don't, either.

339
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,700
我要剥了他们的皮  就像野猪一样
I'm gonna skin them, like javelinas!

340
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,080
别管他们了  他们只是蛀虫
Forget about them! They're insects!

341
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,950
他们...想想他们的母亲
They're -- hey, think about their mother.

342
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,710
我唾弃他们的妈妈
I spit on their mama!

343
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,940
她是个温柔的小女人  她...还是个寡妇
She is a sweet little lady. She -- she's a widow.

344
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,150
她整天拼命工作  没日没夜
She works hard all day, every day,

345
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,320
就像他们外婆一样  从早干到晚
Just like her mother before her, from dawn till dusk,

346
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,220
天天为那些富人擦地板
Scrubbing the floors of rich people.

347
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,190
她连走路都要拄着拐杖
She needs a cane to walk, you know?

348
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,250
她得了关节炎  但还是天天干活
She's got arthritis. And still, she works every day.

349
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,310
为了她自己吗  当然不是
What -- for herself? No. No.

350
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,630
是为了他们  为了他们俩
For them -- for these two,

351
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,370
她的儿子们  她的宝贝
her boys, her apples of her eye.

352
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,600
你想说他们不配拥有这样的母亲吗
You say they don't deserve her?

353
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,460
可能吧  但他们是她唯一的支柱
Maybe so, but they're all she's got.

354
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,940
现在你要是把他们开膛破肚
Now...You turn them inside out,

355
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,900
我希望你想想会对她造成多大的打击
I want you to think about what happens to her.

356
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,140
不  那是他们的错
No, that's on them.

357
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,390
他们早该料到这个下场
They should have thought about that.

358
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,450
当我在你奶奶家时
When I was at your abuelita's place,

359
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,810
你本来准备放了他们
you were gonna let them go.

360
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,560
我觉得那是因为你尽管强硬  但不失公道
Way I see it, that's because you're tough, but you're fair.

361
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,740
你是为了正义
You're all about justice.

362
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,130
我就是这个意思  正义
That's what I'm saying -- justice.

363
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,450
这两个猪脑子  大嘴巴
These -- these two shit-for-brains? These big-mouths?

364
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,700
你已经把他们打得半死
You -- you already beat the living hell out of them.

365
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,890
你觉得他们会忘记今天的教训吗
Do you think they're ever gonna forget today?

366
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,570
不可能的  过了十年
Never -- 10 years from now,

367
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,750
他们回想起来仍然会尿裤子
They're still gonna be crapping their jockeys.

368
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,530
-那还不够  -好吧
- It's not enough. - Okay, okay.

369
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,700
那么罪罚应该相当
Then let's talk proportionality.

370
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,930
他们有罪  成立
They're guilty -- oh, agreed.

371
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,200
现在由你来决定该如何正确量刑
Now you have to decide, what's the right sentence?

372
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,270
像法官一样
Like a judge.

373
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,910
像法官一样
Like a judge.

374
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,330
你听过汉谟拉比法典吗
Ever hear of the Code of Hammurabi --

375
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,880
量刑判罪  以眼还眼
Let the punishment fit the crime, eye for an eye?

376
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,040
以眼还眼
Eye for an eye.

377
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,140
你是说让我戳瞎他们
You want me to blind them.

378
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,250
不  不是
No, no.

379
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,970
他们只是胡说八道
All they did was trash-talk.

380
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,990
那我就把他们的舌头割了
So I cut their tongues out!

381
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,960
等下  我建议...
Wait. See, I'm advising...

382
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,480
你要量刑判罪
that you make the punishment fit the crime.

383
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,690
量刑判罪
Punishment fit the crime.

384
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,690
哥伦比亚领带刑  我要割开他们的喉咙
Columbian neckties -- I cut their throats,

385
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,350
再把他们说谎的舌头从刀缝中拉出来
and then I pull their lying tongues through the slits!

386
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,650
"婊子"
"Biznatch"!

387
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,590
或者  你可以揍到他们眼圈发黑
Or you -- you could give them black eyes.

388
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,890
眼圈发黑  那算什么
Black eyes? That ain't nothing.

389
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,310
你看那边那位  伙计
That one there, homes --

390
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,230
他早就被揍得鼻青脸肿了  蠢货
He already got a black eye, fool.

391
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,600
少帮腔
Stop helping.

392
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,470
或者可以把他们的脚扭断
Or you could sprain their ankles.

393
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,650
-扭断  -他们不是喜欢滑滑板吗
- Sprain? - They're -- they're skateboarders, right?

394
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,550
他们就是这样敲诈别人的
That -- that's how they run their scam.

395
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,370
要是他们不能滑滑板
They can't skate.

396
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,070
你就相当于断了他们的财路
You -- you hit them where they live.

397
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,440
我才不会用扭的  贱人
I ain't spraining nothing, bitch.

398
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,260
我要打断他们的手臂  打断他们的腿
I'm gonna break their arms, and I'm gonna break their legs.

399
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,670
手臂  我们什么时候又扯到手臂上了
Arms? When -- when -- when did we get on to arms?

400
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,520
-我们...  -我要把他们的腿砍下来
- Let's... - I'm cutting their legs off.

401
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,280
你要这样也可以
But -- we could go that way,

402
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,460
我们之前说的是弄断
but...we were talking about breaking.

403
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,500
我觉得咱们方向有点偏了
I think we're heading in the wrong direction.

404
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,700
好的
Okay.

405
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,480
打断他们的腿
Break their legs.

406
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,100
几条腿
How many legs?

407
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,970
两条  他们有两条腿
Two -- they got two legs.

408
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,250
每人  一条腿
One leg -- each.

409
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,100
每人一条吗
One leg -- each?

410
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,070
他们
They're --

411
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:33,660
每人一条  一共两条
One leg each, that's a total of two legs.

412
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,100
听我说
Uh, hey, look.

413
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,480
他们六个月不能玩滑板
They can't skateboard for six months,

414
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
而且会畏惧你一辈子
and they're scared of you forever.

415
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,510
让大家知道你才是老大
You show everybody that you are the man,

416
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,930
但你公平公正
but that you're fair, that you're just.

417
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,250
每人一条腿
One leg each.

418
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,400
很残忍  但也公平
That's tough, but it's fair.

419
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,680
好  按住他们  我没一整天闲工夫
All right, lay 'em out! I ain't got all day!

420
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,500
这里真他妈热
It's hotter than shit out here!

421
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,180
别动  这样只会更难受
Quit moving -- you're only gonna make it worse!

422
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,590
我们知错了  知错了
We're sorry! We're sorry!

423
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,620
看
Look it!

424
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,890
好样的  好样的
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!

425
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:36,170
他说他断了条腿  这下如他所愿
He said he had a broke leg -- now he's got one for real!

426
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,660
向你妈妈道歉  贱人
You -- tell your mama you're sorry, bitch!

427
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,140
另一个
Other one.

428
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,560
看  腿都转了一圈
Look -- it's backwards.

429
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,550
瞧好了
Check it out.

430
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,050
这条要快准狠
I'm gonna do this one real clean.

431
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,900
不  天呐  不
No! Oh, my god! No!

432
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,390
走回家啊  贱人
Walk home now, bitch!

433
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,920
闭嘴  别吵
Shut up! Shut up!

434
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,790
来了  来了  慢点  慢点
Here you go. Here you go. Easy, easy.

435
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,260
-你  疼  疼  -还有力气喊疼
- You -- you -- you -- aah! Aah! - Save your breath.

436
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,850
你是最烂的律师
You -- you are -- you are the worst lawyer,

437
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,060
史上最烂律师
The worst lawyer ever!

438
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,840
我为你谈判  免了你的死刑
Hey, I just talked you down from a death sentence...

439
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,100
-天呐  好疼  -只用服六个月的缓刑
- Oh, my god! Oh, my!- To six months' probation.

440
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,470
我是最棒的律师
I'm the best lawyer ever.

441
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,190
伙计  慢点
Dude, dude, dude, oh!

442
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,710
天呐  不
Oh, my god! Oh! No!

443
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,630
麻烦你
Could you, uh --

444
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,850
不好意思  我马上回来
Could you, um -- I'll be right back.

445

00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:49,630
那就是说  他们在某处藏了一百五十万
So, they have a million and a half bucks somewhere.

598
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,210
是现金么
In what, cash?

599
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,500
我不知道
I don't -- well...

600
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,810
你为什么问这个
Why are you asking me?

601
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,130
我打算抢他们
I'm gonna rip them off.

602
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,310
我喜欢打劫小偷
I like ripping off thieves

603
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,020
因为他们没法报警  他们孤立无援
'cause they can't go to the cops -- they have no recourse.

604
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,790
你告诉我他们的钱藏在哪儿
You point me at where they have their cash --

605
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:11,760
我会付你  怎么说来着
I'll pay you -- a what do you call it? --

606
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,480
中介费  付你百分之十  就是十万
A finder's fee -- call it 10%, 100 large.

607
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,590
你怎么会来找我呢
Well, uh, why w-- why would you come to me for that?

608
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,910
你不是早试过抢他们了么
You already tried ripping them off.

609
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,870
我只是继续你未完成的事业
I'm gonna finish what you started.

610
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,950
我没想抢他们
I-I wasn't trying to rip them off.

611
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,940
我只是想接他们的活儿
I-I just wanted their business.

612
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:33,730
好吧
Okay.

613
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,410
我不知道他们把钱放在哪里
I don't know where their money is.

614
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,170
你这么聪明  肯定能找到的
Smart guy like you could figure it out.

615
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,620
给我需要的信息  我们就皆大欢喜
If I know what I need to know, nobody gets hurt.

616
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,270
我们抢了他们  轻轻松松拿钱
We rip them off -- easy money.

617
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,160
听着  我是个律师  不是罪犯
Hey, look, I'm a lawyer, not a criminal.

618
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,200
你在逗我吗
You are shitting me.

619
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,830
我打破了底线  犯了错误
I crossed a line. I made a mistake.

620
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,110
我不会再犯  再也不会
I'm not doing that again, not ever.

621
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,910
你和屠库之间全靠我挡着
I got between you and Tuco.

622
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,170
要是我当时不帮你说话  你还能在这儿
Do you think you'd be here now -- I kept my mouth shut?

623
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,260
我很感激  算我欠你的
And I appreciate that. I owe you.

624
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,880
以后你要是有麻烦  当然没有更好
A-and if you're ever in trouble, god forbid,

625
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,060
法律上的麻烦
legal trouble,

626
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,800
我一定随叫随到  为你辩护
I will be there, 24-7, as a lawyer.

627
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,510
你有什么打算
What's your angle?

628
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,160
不  我没有打算
No -- no angle.

629
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,140
今天的事我不会对任何人讲
And I'm not saying anything about this to anybody.

630
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,990
因为我把你当成我的客户
As far as I'm concerned, you're a client.

631
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,950
而这只是一次咨询
This is a consultation,

632
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,880
你刚刚和我说的一切都会保密
and everything you just told me is privileged.

633
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,380
要敢说出去  你就死定了
You rat, you die.

634
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,740
放心  保证不说
And that, too, yes.

635
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,630
什么时候想通了打给我
For when you figure out you're in the game.

636
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,960
我不会参与的
I'm not in the game.

637
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,850
我保证
I-I promise.
