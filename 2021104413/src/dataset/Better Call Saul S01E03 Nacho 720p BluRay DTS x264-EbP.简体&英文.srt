第一  兔八哥应该向左转
Bugs Bunny should have taken a left turn there.

第二  就算给我一百次机会
And give me 100 tries,

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,460
我也拼不对这个地名
I'll never be able to spell it.

不过你也看得出
Anyway as you can see,

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,810
我现在遇到点小麻烦
I'm in a-a bit of a pickle.

You face being labeled a sex offender, Jimmy.

If that happens,

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,550
你一辈子都摆脱不了
it'll follow you for the rest of your life.

41
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,470

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,950
这就是故意栽赃的狗屁罪名  查克
Th-that is a trumped-up load of horse crap, Chuck.

- Come on. - Is that what I tell the judge --

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,140
"故意栽赃的狗屁罪名"
"Trumped-up load of horse crap"?

But it was a simple Chicago Sunroof.

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,480
我们几乎没有你的消息
We barely hear from you.

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,730
现在你把自己弄进了牢里
Now that you're in it up to your neck,

62
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,210
你却没胆自己打给我
you can't even call me yourself,

63
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,560
反而让妈妈来找我
you have mom call me?

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,480
是老妈自己要打给你的
Mom took it upon herself to call you!

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,100
我只是告诉她我在哪里
I was just letting her know where I was.

66
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,010
-你没在电话里跟她哭诉吗  -怎么可能
- You didn't cry to her on the phone? - What? No.

67
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,430
你没有哭着向她求助
You didn't cry and beg mom for help?

68
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,140
怎么可能
What? Jesus!

69
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,480
我只说了她想听的话而已
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,360

我不会透露案件细节给你的  晚安
I'm not talking details of the case with you. Goodnight.

155
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,070
这么多钱要藏在哪
Where do you stash all that dough?

156
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,320
除了买那艘破船
I mean, besides for buying that idiotic boat.

157
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,130
这就是罪证
Hello, guilty.

158
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,520
赶紧挂了吧
Hanging up now.

159
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,450
这个人很可能会成为目标
This guy's -- yeah, he's probably a target.

160
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,670
有人可能会打坏主意
Somebody might get some bad, bad ideas.

161
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,110
如果凯特尔曼没处理好这些钱
You know, if Kettleman isn't careful with that money,

162
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,220
他全家都会有危险
I mean his whole family could be in danger.

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,930
什么"危险"
What do you mean, "Danger"?

164
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,230
吉米  你为什么这么说
Jimmy, why would you say that?

165
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,240
什么
What?

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,470
你说他全家都会有危险
You said the family might be in danger.

167
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,080
是吗  我...
I did? I...  I...

168
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,010
我喝多了
I'm -- I'm drunk.

169
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,520
只是自言自语罢了
So, I'm just, I'm thinking out loud.

170
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,240
只是这念头挥之不去
I'm -- I'm up, spinning,-- spinning thoughts.

171
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,770
-真的吗  -是啊
- You sure? - Yeah.

172
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,990
当然
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,760
明天法院见
So, I will see you down in the court bowels mañana.

174
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,750
晚安  金
Goodnight, Kim.

175
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,630
晚安  吉米
Goodnight, Jimmy.

176
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,090
我不是英雄
I'm no hero.

I am not sure. Wait.

189
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,240
麻烦再说一遍
Say -- say that again, please.

190
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,100
他们知道钱的事了

小心
Watch out.

192
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,990

警告你们  你们有危险

195

我是个善意的陌生人  你们全家有危险
This is a friendly stranger. Your whole family's in danger.

196
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,850
钱  他们知道钱的事了
The money -- they know about the money!

197
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,420
你信号很差
You have a terrible connection.

198
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,900
警告你们
I'm warning you.

199
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,610
他们知道钱的事了  注意
They know about your money. Be careful.

200
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,670
-你觉得  -你能换条信号好的线路吗
- Do you think... - Can you call back on a better line?

201
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,500
凯特尔曼一家  你们有危险
Kettlemans, you're in danger.

202
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,340
他们来找你要钱了  再见
They're coming for your money. Bye.

203
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,690
他说什么  我们...
What did he say? We're...

204
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,130
有危险  他们来了
In danger. They're coming.

205
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,580
谁...
Who...

206
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,320
谁来了
Who's coming?

207
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,440
这样如何  减去已服刑期加心理辅导
Okay, how about this -- time served plus counseling?

208
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,400
-不行  -这是他初犯
- Can't do it. - It's his first offense.

209
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,180
不行  麦吉尔
Can't do it, McGill.

210
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,490
就会说"不行"  "不行"
"Can't do it." "Can't do it."

211
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,970
我的话你就听不进去吗
Would you work with me here?

212
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,840
我在听  不是吗
I'm listening, aren't I?

213
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,170
你根本没听进去
Well, you're kind of a captive audience.

214
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,540
你中午吃了什么  整只烤怪兽吗
What did you eat for lunch -- the whole roast beast?

215
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,240
真有趣
Funny.

216
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,170
行  好吧
Okay. Okay.

217
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,730
好好听我说
But hear me out.

218
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,250
他已经蹲了三十天  就有六十天的信用期
The 30 he's done, which is a 60 credit,

219
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,950
再加六十天
plus 60 additional days.

220
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,110
不行
Can't do it.

221
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,210
最低报价  算上他已经蹲的一共六个月
Best offer -- six months, plus the time he's done,

222
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,360
良好表现减刑一半  九十天
half time for good behavior -- out in 90.

223
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,740
-不能再多了  -不可能
- That's my final. - That's never gonna happen.

224
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,900
算了吧  你开玩笑吗
Come on. Now, are you joking?

225
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,040
这是最佳的提议了
Now, that is the best deal you're gonna get.

226
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,010
不行
I can't do it.

227
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,660
你的委托人酒驾闯入购物中心
Your guy drove drunk into a shopping center

228
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,970
杀了三个人
and killed three people.

229
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,740
什么购物中心  我说的是德斯蒙德·罗哈斯
Wait. Shopping center? Desmond Rojas.

230
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,690
持枪抢劫贩酒店
Armed robbery, liquor store.

231
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,760
他用一瓶咖啡酒攻击了收银员
He assaulted a cashier with a bottle of kahlua.

232
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,050
我刚在想达里尔·雷德伍德
I was thinking of Daryl Redwood.

233
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,660
行  我的错  德斯蒙德·罗哈斯  你说
Yeah, okay. My bad. Desmond rojas. Okay, go.

234
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,680
再说一遍
Start over.

235
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,140
我才不再说一遍
I am not starting over.

236
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,790
我每天绞尽脑汁  一个案子只拿七百块
I'm busting my nut here every day for 700 a throw,

237
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,120
还要闻你的屎臭
inhaling your B.M.,

238
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,100
简直是直接从恶魔屁眼里拉出来的
which is straight from satan's bunghole,

239
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,550
结果你竟分不清两个被告
and you can't tell one defendant from another?!

240
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,150
表现良好服刑九十天  就这样了
90 days with good behavior -- we're doing this.

241
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,770
行  好的
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

242
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,700
说  说清楚  "我接受此提议"
Say it. Say the words, "I accept the deal."

243
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,230
行  我...我接受此提议
Yeah, I-I accept -- I accept the deal.

244
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:26,820
早上好
Good morning.

245
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,640
问我什么意思是什么意思
W-what do you mean, what did I mean?

246
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,300
我...没  说过我当时醉了  我只是
I-I -- no, I told you. I-I was drunk. I just --

247
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,520
金  你为什么...问我这个
Kim, why are you -- why are you asking me this?

248
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,590
靠
Oh, damn it.

249
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,970
给  我真有急事
Here. I'm in a real rush.

250
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,870
没时间去认证
I didn't have time to get the validation.

251
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,600
行  九美元
Fine. 9 bucks.

252
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,310
我钱不够
I-I don't have it.

253
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,690
我只有五美元  行吗
I have $5. Please?

254
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,440
你懂规矩  要么给钱要么认证
You know the drill -- money or the validation.

255
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,940
真是急事  好吗
Look, this is an emergency, okay?

256
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,370
非常严重危急的事
A serious, serious emergency.

257
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,020
我得出去
I have to get out of here.

258
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,630
我以我祖宗的灵魂发誓
I promise, on the souls of my forefathers,

259
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,650
我回来就去弄贴纸
I will get you the stickers when I come back.

260
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,580
只要你让我出去  我就多给你一张
I will get you extra if you just let me go.

261
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,070
行
Fine!

262
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,650
行  你要让我走回去弄贴纸吗
Fine! You're gonna make me walk back and get the stickers?!

263
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,600
我会走回去弄贴纸的
I will walk back and get the stickers!

264
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,330
不是我逼你  这都是规定
I'm not making you do anything. Those are the rules.

265
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,350
只要你晚上睡得安稳
Hey, whatever helps you sleep at night.

266
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,100
去你的  死老头
Screw you, geezer!

267
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,890
调度中心  收到
Copy that, dispatch.

268
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,260
吉米  什么风把你吹来了
Jimmy. What brought you here?

269
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,620
我...
Me? Uh...

270
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,880
我在听警用广播
Uh, I-I was surfing the police scanner.

271
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,110
我听说这边出了什么乱子
I heard there was big activity out this way.

272
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,370
这边没你的事  下次再来吧
Well, there's no business for you here, so maybe next time.

273
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,750
是一起入室案吗  凯特尔曼他们家没事吧
Uh, it was a home invasion? Uh, the Kettlemans okay?

274
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,050
我们不知道
Uh, we don't know.

275
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,850
昨天晚上邻居遛狗经过时
A neighbor was walking the dog last night

276
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,440
发现前门大开着
and saw the front door wide open.

277
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,010
屋子里被洗劫一空  一家人都不知所踪
The place was ransacked. No sign of the family.

278
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,660
也没有留言  所以我们还在调查
There's no note, so... We're still figuring it out.

279
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,870
我得回去了
I got to get back.

280
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,800
当然了  祝你好运
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Good luck.

281
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,290
你为什么要过来
Why did you come here?

282
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,350
我只是在我朋友需要时来支持她
I'm just supporting a friend in her time of need.

283
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,230
你想表示支持吗
You want to be supportive?

284
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,490
那就告诉我你昨晚为什么要那么说
Tell me why you said those things last night.

285
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,040
那些都只是推测
I'm just reading tea leaves,

286
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,220
正如我为什么会知道凯特尔曼他们需要个律师
same way I knew the Kettlemans needed a lawyer.

287
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,710
他们贪污的钱...
All that money floating out there --

288
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,100
稍加揣测就知道肯定有人会来抢
It's logical somebody would come after it.

289
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,410
昨晚你为他们担心  今天他们就失踪了
So, the same night you worry about them, they...disappear?

290
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,090
{\an8}系列电影  用于形容聪明的骗子

291
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,090
太荒唐了  就像《雷普利》一样
Yeah, it's crazy. It's "Ripley's."

292
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,030
吉米  不单单是克雷格和贝茜·凯特尔曼
Jimmy, it's not just Craig and Betsy Kettleman --

293
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,080
还有他们的两个孩子
It's their two kids, as well.

294
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,240
如果你能帮忙找到他们  一定会告诉我们吧
You would...say something if you could help find them, right?

295
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,630
我不...我不知道发生了什么
I don't -- I don't know what happened to them.

296
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,820
真的  我不知道
Really, I d-- I don't know.

297
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,470
你逗留得越久
The longer you stay here,

298
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,940
我要跟哈姆林解释得就越多
the more explaining I have to do to Hamlin.

299
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,240
我迟点再跟你说
I'll talk to you later.

300
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,580
如果我能帮上忙  就告诉我
Hey, you'll tell me if there's anything I can do?

301
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,810
会没事的
Everything is gonna be fine.

302

会解决的
It's gonna work out.

303
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,390
没事  会没事的
A-okay. It's gonna be fine.

304
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,490
我是纳乔  请留言

是的  我...
Uh, yes, I'm, uh...

00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,530
我是之前跟你谈过的那一方
This is the party you spoke to the other day.

307
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,430
我很想帮你摆脱
Uh, and I sincerely want to help you

308
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,120
你现在的困境
de-escalate your situation,

309
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,900
利用合法的或其他手段
uh, legally and otherwise.

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,940

Um, so call me at

311
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,600

我是纳乔  请留言

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,330
纳乔  你好
Yeah, Nacho, hi.

316
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,510
声明一点  我什么都不知道
Uh...Just to clarify, look, I don't know anything.

317
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,440
我跟谁都没说过
Uh, I have spoken to no one,

318
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,960
也没人监听这个电话
and, uh, there are no rats on this ship.

319
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,800
但是鉴于有多人卷入此事
But for the sake of everyone involved,

320
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,630
我只是想和你说清楚
I would just like to open a dialogue.

321
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,070
所以  146-8729
So...146-8729.

322
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,650
请尽快打给我
call me when you get this.

323
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,760
如果我之前没说清楚
If I didn't say it before,

324
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,020
现在我们分秒必争
time is of the essence on this matter,

325
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,160
我还是先挂了  以免你正好打过来
so, uh, I'm gonna hang up now -- if you're trying to call.

326
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,850
如果你听到忙音  这边没有呼叫等待
Uh, there's no call waiting here if you get a busy signal.

327
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,940
146-8729.

328
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,390
继续打  我在边上
Just keep trying. I'll be here.

329
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,010
我能解决这个麻烦  如果真有麻烦的话
I can put out this fire, if there is a fire.

330
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,290
我希望这一切都只是一个误会
By hope of hopes, this is all a big misunderstanding.

331
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,000
146-8729.

332
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,920
喂
Hello?

333
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,600
喂  纳乔
Hello? Nacho?

334
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,930
纳乔
Nacho?

335
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,630
走  继续走
Walking. Just walking.

336
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,930
一个人散步而已
Just strolling along.

337
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,860
-感谢上帝  救命  -趴下  举起手来
- Oh, thank God! Help! Help! - Down! Show us your hands!

338
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,320
-不许动  趴下  -你们是警察
- Stop! On the ground! - Oh, you guys are cops?

339
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,090
-举起手来  -我膝盖不好
- Show us your hands! - I got bad knees! Ow! Ohh!

340
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,580
别这样  警官
come on, officers.

341
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,240
你们弄错了  我叫詹姆斯·麦吉尔
You're making a mistake. My name's McGill, James McGill.

342
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,480
我是个律师
I'm an attorney.

343
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,170
轻点  轻点
Easy, easy!

344
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,870
是他的律师
It's his lawyer.

345
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,050
谁的律师
Whose lawyer?

346
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,700
你确定他找的是我吗
You sure he asked for me?

347
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,290
到底进不进去
Going in or what?

348
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,170
你要求找我  我来了
You asked for me, and I have come.

349
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,790
我想告诉你这一步走得很正确
I want to tell you this was a wise move --

350
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,280
很聪明  因为我来这儿是帮助  每个人
very smart, because I'm here to help...everyone --

351
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,720
所有人  特别是你
all parties, but mostly you.

352
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,200
那两个警探
Uh, those two detectives --

353
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,410
他们刚给我说了很多
they just gave me an earful.

354
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,580
他们告诉我的就是
And what they were telling me is --

355
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,950
情况很棘手
it's problematic.

356
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,500
我会再给你复述一遍
I'm gonna pitch it back to you

357
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,790
这样我们才能达成共识
so I know we're on the same page.

358
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,730
女邻居连续两天晚上
A neighbor lady saw a suspicious van

359
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,430
看到可疑车辆停放在
parked across the street from the

360
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,700
凯特尔曼家对面的马路上
Kettlemans' house two nights in a row.

361
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,750
她记下了车牌号
She wrote down the license plate.

362
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,810
也就是你的车牌号
It was your license plate.

363
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,550
警察追查到了你的车和你
Cops tracked your van and you,

364
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,360
搜了车  并在地板上发现了血迹
searched it, and found blood on the floor.

365
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,560
就这么多
So...here we are.

366
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,040
他们在请联调局介入
They're calling the FBI in on this,

367
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,800
这就会变成联邦案件
which makes it federal.

368
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,310
这很糟糕  纳乔
That's a bad thing, Nacho.

369
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,010
这非常糟
That's -- that's very bad,

370
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,530
但是如果你告诉我那家人在哪儿
but if you tell me where the family is,

371
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,070
如果你现在就说出来
if -- if you give them up now --

372
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,490
通力合作  并深深懊悔所做一切
full cooperation, deep remorse --

373
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,690
要把你的刑期
I feel very good

374
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,230
谈到最低限度  我很有信心
about knocking your sentence down to the minimum --

375
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,020
也就十八年
18 years.

376
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,180
他们很看中表现良好这件事
They take this good-behavior thing very seriously,

377
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,930
所以从现在开始
so start here, right here.

378
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,550
告诉我那家人没事儿
Tell me the family is okay.

379
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,450
告诉我孩子们没事儿
Tell me the kids are okay.

380
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:48,530
你想跟我讨论一下你的想法吗
Y-you want to tell me your thoughts and weigh in?

381
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,830
这是你能够接受的计划吗
Does this sound like a plan that you can get behind?

382
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:58,180
你这个可怜虫
You miserable piece of shit.

383
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,720
-你陷害了我  -我怎么了
- You set me up. - I what?

384
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,800
你把我的计划告诉了另一伙人
You gave my score to another crew,

385
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,310
现在你在陷害我
and now you're setting me up.

386
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,760
我  什么跟什么啊  警察打你了吗
I -- what the what? D-did the cops beat you?

387
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,100
因为你现在说的话就像是头撞坏了
'Cause you're talking like a person with head trauma.

388
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,140
你觉得自己很有趣吗
You think you're funny?

389
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,720
你在说什么
What are you saying?

390
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,580
你是说你跟这事完全没关系吗
Are you saying that you had nothing to do with this?

391
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,590
房子外面停的确实是你的货车
That was your van outside the house.

392
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,320
-你不在那儿吗  -是  我在
- Y-you weren't there? - Yeah, I was there.

393
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,800
我是去踩点
I was casing the place,

394
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,770
观察最好的进出路线
figuring out the best way in and out,

395
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,820
他们什么时间睡觉之类的
what time they went to bed -- all that.

396
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,460
我离开的时候他们都好好的  就这样
They were fine when I left. That's it.

397
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,500
你跟凯特尔曼一家没任何关系吗
You had nothing to do with the Kettlemans?

398
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,740
我从未进过屋子
I was never in the house.

399
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,580
货车里的血迹怎么解释
What about the blood in your van?

400
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,150
如果他们要查车上的DNA
They DNA my ride,

401
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,710
他们只会发现那对滑板小毛头的血迹
all they're gonna find is the blood of your skate-rat twins,

402
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,430
还有你在那儿的时候
plus whatever piss and shit

403
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,520
留下的那些狗屁痕迹
you leaked out when you were in there.

404
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,110
自那之后没人再进过那里
Nobody's been in the back of that van since.

405
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,250
我  我不明白
I...I don't understand.

406
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,930
我是这么理解的  律师
Here's what I understand, counselor.

407
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,010
我只把我的计划告诉了另外一个人
I told my plan to one other person.

408
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,990
就是你
One -- you.

409
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,800
现在我被捕了
Now here I am, under arrest.

410
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,270
自己想去吧
Go figure.

411
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,540
我不知道什么陷害或是另一伙人
I don't know anything about a setup or another crew.

412
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,690
知道吗  我一点儿不在乎
You know what? I don't even care.

413
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,830
警察已经去调查我的生意了
The cops are out there right now, poking into my business,

414
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,780
如果他们真的查到我或我伙计什么
and if they find something on me or my partners, for real,

415
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,350
对你来说将会很糟糕  很糟糕
it's gonna be bad for you -- really bad.

416
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,280
糟糕  在哪方面糟糕
Bad? Bad as in...

417
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,000
今天你把我弄出去
You get me out of here today...

418
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,820
否则你死定了
Or you're a dead man.

419
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,720
我问你是不是知道什么
I asked if you knew anything.

420
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,010
你没跟我说你在代理头号嫌疑犯啊
You didn't tell me you were representing the lead suspect.

421
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,740
那个时候我还不知道
I didn't know it at the time.

422
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,060
他交待什么了吗
He give up anything?

423
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,890
-什么  -他说没说那家人在哪里
- What? - Did he tell you where the family is?

424
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,490
他  他不知道
H-he doesn't know.

425
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,800
他不知道是什么意思
W-what does that mean -- he doesn't know?

426
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,960
他把他们交给其他人了吗
He gave them to somebody else?

427
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,700
他不知道是因为不是他做的
He -- he doesn't know because he didn't do it.

428
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,910
天哪  少蒙我
Ah, christ. Give me a break.

429
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,750
两位  能让我俩单独谈谈吗
Guys, can you give us just a minute?

430
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:43,010
吉米  那家人现在真的很危险
Jimmy, that family is in real danger.

431
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,330
你不能因为是他的律师就包庇他
You don't have to stand behind attorney-client privilege.

432
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,380
我没有
I'm not.

433
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,750
那家人现在可能正被囚禁在小屋里
These people can be buried in a box,

434
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,900
连呼吸都成困难
sucking air through a straw right now.

435
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,700
如果真是这样  我感到很抱歉
And I'm sorry if that's where they are,

436
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,920
但真不是我的委托人做的
but my guy didn't do it.

437
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,370
你为什么这么肯定
How are you so sure?

438
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,290
知道你们接下来应该干什么吗
You know what you're gonna do?

439
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,480
你们应该找专门的鉴证人员
You're gonna get your special CSI people, right?

440
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,420
检测货车里留下的血迹
And you're gonna test the blood from that van,

441
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,340
因为我可以打包票
because I guarantee you, one billion percent,

442
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,620
那绝对不是凯特尔曼一家的血
it's not the Kettlemans'.

443
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,800
那是谁的
Whose is it?

444
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,360
反正不是他们的  尽管去测试就是了
I-it's not the Kettlemans'. Just test it.

445
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,390
那得花几星期时间
That'll take weeks,

446
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,980
这还是在我们可以搞到DNA样本对比的情况下
if we could even get a DNA sample to compare it to.

447
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,490
那还不是小意思嘛
Well, isn't that convenient?

448
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,150
你们已经关押了个无辜的人
You've got an innocent man in there right now,

449
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,470
我要求你们释放他并向他道歉
who I demand you release with an apology!

450
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,860
没有其他嫌疑犯
Look, there are no other suspects.

451
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,290
没有任何证据指向其他人
There's no evidence that points to anyone else.

452
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,280
既然这样  我想去看看案发现场
Well, then, I want to see the crime scene,

453
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,590
因为你们肯定漏掉了什么
'cause you guys are missing something.

454
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,600
去你的吧  漏掉个毛线
Screw you, "Missing something."

455
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,550
不  警探们  我觉得这是个好主意
No, detectives, I, um... I think that's a good idea.

456
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,630
-好主意  -是的
- A good idea? - Yes.

457
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,050
我觉得我们应该请麦吉尔先生到那里看看
I think we should invite mr. McGill to the house.

458
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,270
为什么
why?

459
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,380
是啊  为什么
Yeah, why?

460
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,190
我们漏掉了什么
So, what did we miss?

461
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,280
这是他们十二岁的儿子沃伦的房间
This is the son's room -- Warren. 12 years old.

462
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,070
这是乔乔的房间
Jo Jo's room.

463
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,330
她七岁
She's 7.

464
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,080
好吧  你们不就是想看我笑话吗
All right, you wanted me to crack?

465
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,790
你们成功了
Mission accomplished.

466
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,760
但我告诉你们  不是我的委托人做的
But I'm telling you -- my client didn't do this.

467
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,230
我们知道瓦尔加那晚在房子外面
We know Varga was outside the house

468
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,750
而那晚这家人就失踪了  这是事实
the night the family disappeared. That is a fact.

469
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,600
不管你想怎么为他辩解
Advocate for the guy all you want

470
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,470
都得让我们先把这家人平安救出来
after we get these people back safe.

471
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,550
在此期间  你得帮帮我们
In the meantime, help us.

472
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,030
洋娃娃哪儿去了
Where's the doll?

473
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,720
什么东西哪儿去了
Where's the what?

474
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,060
小鞋子  小衣服
Uh, got little shoes, a bunch of clothes,

475
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,390
桌椅  梳子都在
a table and chairs, hairbrush,

476
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,860
但主角洋娃娃去哪儿了
but where's the doll that goes with all this stuff?

477
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,590
这个小女孩的每张照片里
In every picture of this little girl,

478
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,840
都抱着一个同样的洋娃娃
she's holding the same doll.

479
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,280
所以  洋娃娃去哪儿了
So, where's the doll?

480
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,980
这有什么打紧吗
What does it matter?

481
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,800
洋娃娃不见了  小女孩也不见了
Doll is gone -- girl is gone,

482
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,150
这就表示洋娃娃和小女孩很可能在一起
which means doll and girl are most likely together,

483
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,000
也就是说
which means...

484
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,380
我不知道这代表什么
I have no idea what that means.

485
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,960
这代表那个孩子不是被拖出家门的
Which means the kid wasn't dragged out of the house.

486
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,530
-事实表明[拉丁语]...  -慢着  
- Ipso facto... - Wait. Wait.

487
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,570
你在说什么
What are you saying?

488
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,400
可能凯特尔曼一家人绑架了自己
Maybe the Kettlemans kidnapped themselves.

489
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,600
够了  你不用说了  我们走吧
That's it. You're -- you're -- you're done. Let's go.

490
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,000
-这完全讲得通  -怎么说
- I-it makes perfect sense. - How does it make sense?

491
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,210
他们为什么那么做
Why would they do that?

492
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,890
他们盗取了一百多万美元  对吧
They stole a million dollars-plus, right?

493
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,010
如果你想带着那么多诱人的现金远走高飞
You -- you want to get away with all that yummy cash,

494
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,960
你会怎么做  逃走吗  不  当然不能
what do you do -- run? No, you can't.

495
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,430
如果你逃走  大家就都知道你犯了罪
If you run, everyone knows you're guilty. Ah!

496
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,050
但如果你被绑架了那你就是受害者  对吗
But if you're kidnapped, you're a victim, right?

497
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,080
他们导演了这场绑架  迷惑别人
They staged this to throw everyone off.

498
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,700
你们陷入了误区
You guys are looking in the wrong place.

499
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,910
他们现在可能正躲在
Who knows how many miles into

500
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,940
墨西哥或加拿大的哪个角落呢
Mexico or Canada they could be?

501
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,590
你们得放出消息查一查
You -- you got to put the word out.

502
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,680
别这样
Oh, co-come on.

503
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,580
你们不觉得我说的可能是对的吗
You don't think it's possible I'm right?

504
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,580
可能...不太可能
It's possible -- unlikely.

505
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,540
-不太可能  -他们所有车都在这儿
- Unlikely? - All their cars are here.

506
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,430
没有任何出租车或汽车服务的记录
There's no record of a taxi or car service to the house,

507
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,130
他们也没有乘坐飞机  汽车或火车
And they didn't get on any planes or buses or trains.

508
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,190
-这些你们都查过了吗  -是的
- You checked all that? - Yes, we checked it.

509
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,800
还有那洋娃娃  我们早注意到它不见了
And the doll -- it's not news. We saw it was missing.

510
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,970
那它在哪呢
So where is it?

511
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,750
那小女孩可能是吓哭了
The girl was scared, crying.

512
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,260
为了让她安静点  坏人就让她带了洋娃娃
Bad guy lets the kid take the doll to shut her up.

513
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:41,750
怎么了
What?

514
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,210
你觉得那不可能吗
You don't think that's possible?

515
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,680
我要和你单独谈谈
I need to talk to you alone.

516
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,390
我得偷偷告诉你点事
I've got to tell you something on the q.t.,

517
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,170
你得先保证  不许发火
and promise not to be upset with me.

518
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,920
我可不能保证
No way am I making that promise.

519
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,570
我给凯特尔曼他们家打了电话
I called the Kettlemans.

520
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,000
昨晚给你打完后  我就去打电话警告他们了
After I hung up with you, I gave them a warning call.

521
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,770
打电话警告他们
A warning call?

522
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,800
是的  我担心瓦尔加想拿他们的钱
Yeah, I was worried my guy Varga was going after their money.

523
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,310
他果然去了  他就计划去抢钱的
And he was. He was gonna rip them off.

524
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,600
我从我们之前的谈话中推断出来的
I deduced it from a conversation that we had.

525
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,970
我和他是律师和委托人的关系
It was lawyer to client,

526
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,610
所以我得对他的事情保密
So there was, you know, confidentiality issues.

527
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,710
但我给凯特尔曼家打匿名电话警告他们
But I called the Kettlemans anonymously to warn them.

528
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,600
匿名的
Anonymously?

529
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,780
你不会是...老天  你难道
You didn't -- oh, god, you didn't --

530
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,490
你是模仿性爱机器人的声音吗
You didn't do the sex-robot voice, did you?

531
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,740
是的  就用一个管子堵住嘴巴
I did, with the tube and the whole thing,

532
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,440
那声音很可能把他们吓了个半死
which probably scared the living shit out of them,

533
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,310
于是  你看  他们就跑了
And they took off, which, you know,

534
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,420
造成了这种"意外后果"
file that under "Unintended consequences,"

535
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,310
你现在信我了吗
But you -- you believe me now?

536
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,930
太好了
Uh... Great.

537
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,290
我们现在只要找到他们就好
Now we have to find them.

538
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:42,000
不过  最好先让警察把瓦尔加放出来
I mean -- or, better yet, get the cops to let Varga go

539
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,240
我现在可是如履薄冰  危在旦夕
because right now my ass is on a highway to the danger zone.

540
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,600
你怎么这么说
Well, why are you in danger?

541
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,170
纳乔·瓦尔加并没有绑架这家人
Nacho Varga -- he didn't kidnap the family.

542
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,670
但他的确是个坏蛋  非常坏
But he's a bad guy. He's a very bad guy.

543
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,350
如果警察继续纠缠他
And if the cops keep pushing him,

544
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,450
他们就要发现一些不好的事
they're gonna find something.

545
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,250
然后  纳乔就要怪到我头上
And when that happens, Nacho blames me,

546
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,330
再然后  这些人就要把我当人肉皮纳塔打
And then his guys turn me into a meat Piñata.

547
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:02,330
{\an8}皮纳塔  内装满玩具与糖果  让人用棍棒打击

548
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:03,620
吉米  去和警察说啊
Jimmy, tell the police.

549
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,070
不行  我死也不能卖了他们
No, there's n-- there's no way I'm gonna rat on this guy.

550
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,310
否则我永世不得安宁
I will never be safe.

551
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,620
不行  我得先去说服那些警察
No, I have to convince the cops that I'm right,

552
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,110
让他们别再缠着纳乔
get them to stop looking at Nacho,

553
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,860
然后去抓在逃的凯特尔曼一家
and catch the Kettlemans on the run.

554
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,810
要是警察没抓到他们呢
And if they never catch them?

555
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,490
你说凯特尔曼一家
The Kettlemans?

556
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,720
你也见过他们对吧
Well, you've met these people, right?

557
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,610
这家人压根就没多聪明
They're -- they're not exactly masterminds, right?

558
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,940
只要警察去抓他们  肯定能抓到
They will be caught if the cops are looking for them,

559
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,970
你快去让警察抓他们  好不好
So you tell them to, would you?

560
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,280
让联调局也去  听说他们也介入此事了
The FBI, too -- I heard they're getting in on this.

561
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,830
人家联调局凭什么听我的
Why would the FBI listen to me?

562
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,080
那就让哈姆林去说  他们一定听他的
Well, Hamlin -- they'll listen to him, right?

563
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,020
至少警局会听话吧  你去和霍华德说说
APD, at least. Y-you -- you talk to Howard.

564
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,360
向他解释清楚
You explain things to him.

565
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,900
他还是有影响力的
He has clout with these people.

566
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,660
这是什么意思  不行吗
What? Is -- is that a no or...

567
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,090
哈姆林一定不会干
Hamlin will never agree to it.

568
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,360
凯特尔曼夫妇是我们的委托人
The Kettlemans are our clients.

569
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,970
这样无异于说他们有罪
This would mean incriminating them.

570
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,610
你看  所以人们才痛恨律师
Oh, you -- you see? This is why people hate lawyers.

571
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,140
这事哈姆林说了算  而他一定不会同意的
It's Hamlin's call, and Hamlin will never agree.

572
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,750
即便是我说了算  你也知道我不会同意
And even if it were up to me, you know I couldn't.

573
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,340
对不起  我真的
I'm sorry. I just --

574
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,380
我知道了
I get it.

575
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:04,980
你要去哪
Where are you going?

576
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,630
我要去和纳乔谈谈
I'm gonna go talk to Nacho.

577
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,070
去给他说说理
I'll try to make him see reason.

578
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,100
去求他
To beg!

579
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,380
{\an8}限高4.5米

580
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,670
快点
Come on.

581
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,390
{\an8}取票口

582
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,000
快出啊
Come on!

583
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,000
好吧  那个...
Right. Yeah. Hey.

584
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,700
那天我是傻逼  行了吧
I was a jerk, okay?

585
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,860
我欠你多少钱  这次都给你
So, I will -- I will pay you what I owe you,

586
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,460
你让我过去  我连本带利都还你
Plus interest, if you just let me come through.

587
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,730
你到别处停车去吧
I suggest you find parking somewhere else.

588
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,220
别处  哪还有别处
Somewhere else, as in -- where somewhere else?

589
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,560
那我管不着
Not my concern.

590
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,410
事实上  这是你的工作
Uh, actually, uh, this is your job,

591
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,610
所以你应该管
So, by definition, it's your concern.

592
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,550
所以赶紧把票给我  把门打开  谢谢
So pump out the ticket and open the stupid gate already, please.

593
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,990
我没时间跟你耗
I mean, I don't have time for this.

594
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,590
好...
All...

595
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,510
好吧
All right!

596
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,660
我就把车停这儿了
Hey. I'm gonna -- I'm gonna park right here.

597
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,850
你胆子大了是吗
I don't think you want to be doing that.

598
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,270
是吗
Oh, yeah?

599
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,320
你能怎么办  里面有装满屎的尿布吗
What are you gonna do? You got a poop-filled diaper in there?

600
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,220
拿出来扔我头上啊
Are you gonna throw it at me?

601
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,590
老掉牙的瘪瘪嘴咬死我啊  死老头子
You gonna gum me to death, huh, geezer?

602
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,880
这可是一家子啊  妈妈爸爸还有俩孩子
We're talking about a family -- Mom, Dad, two kids.

603
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,710
律师的什么狗屁理论
Lawyer's got this bullshit theory

604
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,630
说他们绑架自己  带钱跑路
about them staging this and running off with the money.

605
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,350
你听说了吗
You know the story?

606
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,210
听说了  县财务主管挪用钱款
Yeah, county treasurer embezzled funds.

607
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,170
我看报纸了
I read the paper.

608
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,180
我们抓了一个混混  铁定是他
Yeah, well, we got this gangbanger dead to rights.

609
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,130
唯一的问题就是你那朋友
Only problem is your guy over there.

610
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,660
他得帮我们套出他那委托人的话
He needs to help us get his scumbag client to talk.

611
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,200
你怎么说  同意吗
So, what do you say? You on board?

612
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,430
做点好事帮帮我们
Help us do some good.

613
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,330
当然
Sure.

614
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,230
好  事情是这样的  你攻击了这个人
Okay, here's the deal -- you assaulted this man.

615
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,390
得了吧  我连他毛都没碰到
Give me a break. I barely touched the guy.

616
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,870
但是你先动的手
But you laid hands on him first.

617
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,940
手指  我只对他动了手指
Finger -- I laid finger on him.

618
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,240
你再解释  也是你先攻击的
Well, whatever your interpretation, it was still an assault.

619
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,750
现在这位先生愿意放你一马
Now, this gentleman is willing to let this go,

620
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,140
只要你帮我们  就不会起诉你
not press charges, if you help us out.

621
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,920
你得让你的委托人
You got to get your client

622
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,990
告诉我们这家人被藏在哪了
to tell us where he has the family stashed.

623
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,480
等等  哥们  我都快成复读机了
Wait, guys, I'm the definition of a broken record on this one.

624
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,220
纳乔就是"呐瞧  你们抓错了人了"  懂吗
Nacho is "Not-cho" Man, comprendo?

625
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,530
没人带走凯特尔曼一家  
Nobody took the Kettlemans.

626
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,560
是凯特尔曼一家自己逃走的
The Kettlemans took themselves!

627
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,820
你要还这么说  事情就严重了
You're gonna keep playing that line, it's gonna go rough.

628
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,930
有什么损招  你就使吧
You know what? Do your worst.

629
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,480
好  跟我走  登记去
All right, let's go -- to booking.

630
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,910
行  走
Yeah, sure.

631
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,770
好的
Fine.

632
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,110
美好的一天  善始善终
Perfect end to a perfect day.

633
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,700
等下伙计们  我改主意了
Hey, guys, wait a second. I changed my mind.

634
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:56,660
-你说什么  -我不告他了
- I'm sorry. What?  - I don't want to press charges.

635
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,130
我们不是谈好了  你想起诉他的
We talked about this. You want to press charges.

636
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,670
不想  我不想
No. No, I don't.

637
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,070
你这是干嘛  老兄弟  我们不是一伙的吗
What are you doing, buddy? I thought you had our backs.

638
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,530
我可不记得我说过  老兄弟
No, I don't think I said that, buddy.

639
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,150
怎么着  现在有机会做好事儿  
So, what -- you get a chance to do the right thing

640
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,240
你却像个娘们放弃了
and you puss out?

641
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,600
是的  失之我命啊
Yeah. Well, I guess it's my loss.

642
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,330
卡格尼  莱西
Hey, Cagney, Lacey.

643
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,050
等你们意识到自己现在的错误
When you realize how wrong you are about all this,

644
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,960
送我给果篮  我就当你们道歉了
I'll take an edible arrangement as a "Sorry."

645
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,320
多放点菠萝
Heavy on the pineapple.

646
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,250
等等
Hey. Hold up.

647
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,600
你刚刚为什么就放过我了
How come you let me off the hook back there?

648
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,680
听着  我要回去工作了
Look, I'm going back to work.

649
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,170
你哪儿凉快哪儿呆着去  不用问
Why don't you quit while you're ahead and go on your way?

650
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,760
不行  我不相信
No, I refuse to believe it's because

651
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,320
感觉你体内还是有颗心
you have something resembling a heart inside your body.

652
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,200
再缠着我  五秒以后
You're not gonna have a heart inside your body

653
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,430
你体内那颗心就没了
in about five seconds.

654
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,560
好  不用你说
Okay, don't tell me, all right?

655
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,180
我已经知道你为什么这么做了
I already know why you did it.

656
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,480
是吗  为什么
Yeah? Why is that?

657
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,060
因为你相信我
'Cause you believe me.

658
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,430
那家人自己绑架了自己
That family kidnapped themselves.

659
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,940
好吧  我相信你
All right, I believe you.

660
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,960
我就知道  我就知道
I knew it! I knew it!

661
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,840
终于有人相信我了
Finally, someone believes me!

662
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,710
为什么你会相信我
Why do you believe me?

663
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,070
我听到了细节  你的故事合乎常理
I heard the details. Your story makes sense.

664
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,200
当然了  但...
Of course it does! But...

665
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,520
但话又说回来  就像警察说的
Devil's advocate -- like the cops said,

666
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,490
凯特尔曼家的车还在家里
the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house.

667
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
也没有离开的记录
There's no record of them leaving.

668
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,660
他们怎么出的国
H-how'd they get out of the country?

669
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,560
没出国
They didn't.

670
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,590
很可能他们连那社区都没出
Odds are, they didn't get out of their neighborhood.

671
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,500
什么  你再说一遍
What? What? They -- come again?

672
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:27,060
听着  我在费城当班那会儿
Look when I was still on the job back in Philly,

673
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,210
当时有个案子
We had this case --

674
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,330
等等  别急
Whoa, hold up. Hold up.

675
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,540
这个"当班"是指你以前当过警察吗
Now, wait. "On the job," as in you were a cop on the job?

676
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,710
有个庄家在超级碗赛后失踪了
This bookie disappeared after the Super Bowl --

677
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:39,020
达拉斯牛仔对匹兹堡钢人
Cowboys/Steelers--

678
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,760
由于运气不佳
took $6 million in bets

679
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,660
卷了六百万跑路了
and skipped town when things didn't go his way.

680
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,210
大家都以为他逃到巴哈马享受阳光沙滩
Now, everybody thought he was on the beach in the Bahamas

681
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,700
或是横尸在新泽西的松林滩涂
or dead in the Jersey pine barrens --

682
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,120
结果根本不是那回事
wasn't the case.

683
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,840
他就住在离家不远的一间抵押房里
He was two doors down from where he lived in a foreclosed house.

684
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,160
躲了整整六个月  谁也没怀疑
Hid there for six months without anyone suspecting.

685
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,100
但为什么不一走了之
But -- but why? Why not run?

686
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,240
携款潜逃是定性思维
Now, that's what everybody expects.

687
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,180
但回家是人的本能
It's human nature to want to stay close to home,

688
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,200
所以既要销声匿迹又要掩人耳目
And if this Kettleman figured out how to do it,

689
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,520
凯尔特曼肯定潜藏在家附近
That's what he did.

690
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,470
家是人的根
Nobody wants to leave home.

691
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,250
我知道  我超期待的
I know. It's pretty exciting.

692
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,750
我们好好玩一把  好吗
Let's really sell this one. Okay?

693
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,770

00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,910
是啊  我们在睡前再唱一首吧
Yeah, I think we have time for one more before bed.

721
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:04,960
非唱不可么
Do we have to?

722
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,640
你不唱我唱
Oh, hey, I don't know about you,

723
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,980
我挺想唱这首

Let's really have fun with this one, okay, Kettle team?

晚上好  沃伦
Hey. Hey, Warren.

731
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,910
还有乔乔  抱歉把你们吓了一跳
Hey, Jo Jo. Uh, sorry about that.

732
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,490
我是你们的吉米叔叔  别怕
I'm your uncle Jimmy, all right?

733
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,500
你们爸爸妈妈要带你们
Now, your parents are gonna take you down the mountain,

734
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,820
下山回家  好吗
back to your house. That sound good?

735
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,320
-我们...  -看见没  他们超兴奋的
- Uh, we -- - Yeah, see? They're excited.

736
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,260
麦吉尔先生  我们能谈谈吗
M-Mr. McGill, can we talk about this?

737
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,000
不  不行  没得谈
No, we can't, okay? You're done here.

738
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,800
快收拾收拾  别唱了  准备回家
Pack up your stuff, bury your scat, 'cause we're heading back.

739
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,440
-回归文明社会  -总算能回去了
