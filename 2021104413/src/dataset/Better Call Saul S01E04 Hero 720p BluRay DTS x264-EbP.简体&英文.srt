140
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,530
你怎么想到回旋踢那一出的
Hey, what was that, uh, crazy stuff about roundhouse kicks?

141
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,740
哪来的灵感
Where the hell did you get that?

142
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,600
我不知道
I don't know, man.

143
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,020
这想法早就有了
Just something in my brain, you know?

144
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,490
就这样涌了出来  太过了吗
It just came out. Too much?

145
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,090
不  甚合我意
No. I loved it.

146
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,710
只是感觉略有深意
It was, like, deep or something.

147
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,050
论功绩的话
You want to talk about brilliant?

148
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,510
我们两个当中  你才是主力
I mean, we -- you're the man.

149
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,990
至于我  我喜欢欣赏你干活
Me -- I'm just -- I love watching you work, man.

150
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,260
也就赚点啤酒钱  仅此而已
It's good for making beer money -- that's about all.

151
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,120
{\an8}{\pos(168,211)}绝命律师
第一季 第四集

152
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,090
拜托  没人会知道的
Please, okay? No one has to know.

153
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,280
你可以装作根本没找到我们
I mean, you could just pretend you didn't find us.

154
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,910
我们绝不告诉任何人  是吧克雷格
I -- we would never tell anyone, would we, Craig?

155
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,270
-对  绝对不说  -不会的
- No, absolutely not. - No.

156
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,940
我已经给你们的律师打过电话了
I already called your lawyer.

157
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,870
另外  你们一家这样一走
Besides, this little family outing of yours --

158
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,070
已经让一个无辜的人坐了牢
it's put an innocent man in jail.

159
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,280
警察正把这案子当作绑架案来调查
The cops are investigating this as a kidnapping.

160
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,980
他们已经抓到了一个倒霉的嫌疑人
They already rounded up some poor suspect.

161
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,670
工薪阶级  好像还是个父亲
A -- a-a working-class guy. Father...I think.

162
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,560
不管怎么说  你俩已经毁了某人的人生
But anyway, you two -- you almost ruined someone's life --

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,450
也许是很多人的人生
Potentially several someones.

164
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,380
我们真不知道这些
I -- we had no idea.

165
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,670
会不会是货车里那个人
Could this have been the person in the van?

166
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,850
如果他们抓到的人正好是警告里说的那人呢
What if the man they arrested is the one we were warned about?

167
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,000
这样看来  他可能也没那么无辜
Yeah, maybe he's not so innocent, hmm?

168
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,140
警告  怎么回事
Uh, warned? Warned how?

169
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,810
我们接到一个电话  有人用假嗓音打的
Well, we had a phone call -- someone disguising their voice.

170
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,860
他们说有人要找我们麻烦
Yeah, they said someone was coming for us.

171
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,710
我家外面还停着一辆货车
And there was a van outside the house... yep.

172
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,740
好像有人在车里监视着我们
...as if whoever was inside was watching us.

173
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,720
所以  车一开走
And, uh, once that drove off,

174
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,520
-我们为了孩子就这样做了  -为了孩子
- We...did what we did for the kids. - The kids.

175
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,900
我不知道有这回事
I-I-I wouldn't know about any of that.

176
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,130
我只是...
I just...

177
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,510
我可以向你们保证  你和家人很安全
I can assure you that you and your family are safe.

178
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,670
现在警察已经全权介入  所以
I mean, the police are all over this thing, so...

179
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,230
不是这个问题  我们不能就这么回去
It -- it doesn't matter. Uh, we can't just go back.

180
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,930
是案子的问题  他们不会放过克雷格的
I mean, it's -- our case. They'll crucify Craig.

181
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,400
你能再给韦克斯勒小姐打个电话吗
Can't you just call Ms. Wexler again?

182
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,690
就说你其实根本没看到我们
You know, tell her you didn't see us after all.

183
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,010
如果他们认为我是逃跑的
If they think I ran away,

184
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,670
肯定会怀疑我
it'll look like I did something wrong.

185
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,690
我们不能冒风险
Yeah, and we can't risk losing everything

186
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,860
因为一点小错误就失去一切
just because of some teensy mistake.

187
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,050
-这真的...  -我能问你们点事吗
- I mean, it's... - Can I ask you something?

188
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,100
你们本来是怎么希望的
What -- what were you hoping would happen?

189
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,220
在我找到你们之前  你们有什么打算
I mean, before I found you, what were you planning to do?

190
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,510
我们还在...考虑
Well, we were in the process of, you know, working that out...

191
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,440
-还在考虑...  -然后你就...
- We were working that out. -...When you, um... we were--

192
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,410
好吧
All right, well, uh,

193
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,660
天无绝人之路
you still got a little bit of maneuverability, all right?

194
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,390
你们爱好野外活动  对吧
You -- you're outdoorsy, right?

195
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,490
所以你们就来了一场说走就走的野营
So you went on an impromptu camping trip.

196
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,260
人有时候就是这么任性
I don't know. It's something people do, apparently.

197
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,480
你们把家里搞得一团乱
Uh, you left the house a mess,

198
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,190
把自家前门踹开
and you kicked in your own front door

199
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,640
因为这是个自由国度
because it's a free country.

200
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,590
金·韦克斯勒很厉害  她能让人信服
Kim Wexler is very good. She'll make it work.

201
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,420
那  钱怎么办
Yeah, what -- what about the money?

202
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,090
如果她知道了钱的事  她一定会上报吧
Uh, well, if she knows about it, she'll tell, right?

203
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,180
我是说她不得不上报吧
I mean, she'll have to tell.

204
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,530
就像硅谷人说的那样
Well, like they say in Silicon Valley,

205
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,810
"那不是故障  是产品特色"
"It's not a bug -- it's a feature."

206
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,760
听说过可以放弃的谈判筹码吗
Did you ever hear of a bargaining chip?

207
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,410
我们面前的这一堆
Well, what we have right here

208
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,580
就是可放弃的筹码
is the mother of all bargaining chips.

209
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,480
你是想让我们把钱上交
Um, as in...you expect us to give this back?

210
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,170
我们不会把钱交回去的
We are not giving this back.

211
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,740
我们没有罪  这钱是我们应得的
Uh, we are not guilty. This money belongs to us.

212
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,880
是我们  是克雷格赚到的
We ea-- well, I mean, Craig earned it.

213
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,310
我很努力地工作
I worked very hard...

214
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,260
我周末  节假日都在工作
...You know, weekends and holidays...

215
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,880
-总是白做工  -白做工  一直都是
- ...All unpaid. - All unpaid, always.

216
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,320
虽然给我们发了工资
And -- and, really, just because you're salaried

217
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,880
那也不能不给加班费啊
doesn't mean you don't deserve overtime.

218
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,270
我觉得这样才公平
I-I think that's only fair.

219
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,800
没错  就是这个问题
I mean, really, that's what this is about, right?

220
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,900
-事关公平二字  -没错  公平
- Yeah. Fairness. - Fairness, right.

221
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,590
这不光是合不合法的问题
I mean, not just what's legal.

222
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,450
要说合法  你看奴隶制
If you want to talk about legal, slavery --

223
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,400
以前蓄奴还合法呢
that used to be legal -- human slavery, so...

224
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,860
是这么回事哈
Yeah, this is right up there with that.

225
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,580
求你了  别告诉任何人这笔钱的事
Please, just don't tell anyone about the money.

226
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,780
-我不能受贿  -谁知道啊
- I can't take a bribe. - Who would know?

227
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,870
-我们对谁也不说  -是啊  拿着吧
- We won't tell anyone. - Yeah, take it.

228
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,010
那也不行
I can't take it.

229
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,850
拿着吧  你刚才不是说想帮我们吗
Please. Didn't you say that you wanted to help us?

230
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,410
你就假装从没见过这钱  这不难吧
So just pretend you never saw the money. How hard is that?

231
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,110
快拿着
Take it.

232
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,280
拿着啊
Take it.

233
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,380
我...我真的不能拿
I can't -- I can't take a bribe.

234
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,840
不过
But you know what?

235
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,000
我可以把它当预付金
I can-- I can take a retainer.

236
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,080
预付金
A retainer?

237
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,610
对  我当你们的律师  你们给我预付金啊
Yeah, for my services -- as your lawyer?

238
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,160
-你并不是我们的律师  -现在还不是而已
- You're not our lawyer. - Well, not yet.

239
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,000
我知道  哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所光鲜亮丽
Look...I know that HHM is shiny and it's slick

240
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,890
里面的律师一抓一大把
and it's chock-full of lawyers

241
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,960
和他们相比  我就像个
and, compared to them, I'm like a --

242
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,410
卖柠檬水的小摊  企图和沃尔玛竞争
a kiddy lemonade stand trying to compete with Wal-mart.

243
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,650
但是  我能为你们提供的服务
But here's the thing -- what are you gonna get from me

244
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,940
别人都无法提供
that you're not gonna get from those other guys?

245
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,400
比如我的热情与专注
Passion, commitment.

246
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,640
你们自己想想看  是谁找到你们的
Ask yourself this -- who found you?

247
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,430
我可没看到霍华德·哈姆林
I don't see Howard Hamlin

248
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,200
穿着他三百块的古驰皮鞋来这儿找你们
ruining his $300 Gucci loafers out here.

249
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,000
如果请我  那二位就是我的头号委托人
If you're with me, you're my number-one client.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,760
不管早中晚给我打电话  我随时待命
Morning, noon, or night, you call me -- I'm there.

251
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,690
我将会全心全意为你们服务
I would be singularly devoted to you.

252
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,400
不行吗  为什么
But why not?

253
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,400
对不起
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,480
因为你...
You're just...the...

255
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,270
我怎么了
Just...I'm what?

256
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,720
有罪的人才找你当律师
You're the kind of lawyer guilty people hire.

257
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,780
上报纸了吗
Did it make the paper?

258
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,600
什么
What?

259
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,910
那案子上报纸了吗
Did it make the paper?

260
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,690
什么案子上报纸
Did what make the paper?

261
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,410
好吧  看来是错过截稿期了
Okay, well, probably missed the deadline,

262
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,740
你明早再看  肯定在头版头条
But check it out tomorrow morning -- front page.

263
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,650
凯特尔曼一家四口
The Kettlemans, all four of them --

264
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,060
安然无恙
Safe and sound.

265
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,950
-都让你说中了  -嗯
- Looks like you called it. - Yeah.

266
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,190
他们当时在野营  就在他家后院里
Camping -- you know, pretty much right in their own backyard --

267
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,750
不对  离他家后院还有五英里
Well 5 miles above it.

268
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,590
我的天
Jesus.

269
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,230
那晚真糟糕  我鞋里都是松子
The night I had. I got pine nuts in my shoes.

270
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,410
我是说  这事也太难以置信了
But, I mean, can you believe it?

271
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,590
好吧  你肯定不觉得奇怪
I-I guess you can.

272
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,240
我就是觉得吧
It's just, you know,

273
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:47,490
本以为罪犯要比他们看起来聪明得多
you assume that criminals are gonna be smarter than they are.

274
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,410
我真搞不懂
I don't know.

275
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,670
这事还真让我小难过了一把
It kind of breaks my heart a little.

276
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,820
看你不怎么爱说话啊
Not the loquacious sort, are you?

277
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,090
不是所有人都像你巧舌如簧
We can't all be as blessed as you.

278
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,650
多谢你那天帮我
Well, thanks for your help.

279
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,130
没什么
Don't mention it.

280
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,540
那个  你要是需要帮忙的话...
And, uh, if you ever need any assistance...

281
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,160
{\an8}禁止吸烟

282
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,280
怎么把我的委托人给铐上了
Why is my client in handcuffs?

283
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,990
他是无辜的  是受害人
This man is innocent. He's a victim.

284
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,170
他怎么能戴手铐呢
Why -- why on earth would he be cuffed?

285
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,590
快把手铐摘下来  这下好了
Just go -- go ahead. Take them off. There you go.

286
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,920
你自由了
Free at last!

287
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,780
他告诉你那个好消息了吗
Hey, did he tell you the good news?

288
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,240
根本不是什么绑架  怎么样
Never even kidnapped -- how about that?

289
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,960
全城不戒备一下
A family can't go on a little vacation

290
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,140
人家都不能去野营了是吧
without the whole city going on lockdown?

291
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,350
对了  你那搭档在哪
By the way, where is your partner?

292
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,980
你俩扔硬币你输了是吧
What -- did you lose the coin toss?

293
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,930
我们要他来道歉  你也得道歉
Because we expect an apology from him, as well as you.

294
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,590
你个傻逼  少在这儿得寸进尺
You really don't want to push your luck with me, scumbag.

295
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,640
还有你这混蛋  我们可盯着你呢
You got eyes on you, asshole.

296
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,060
你要再敢犯事  就等着瞧吧
One little slip -- just one.

297
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,750
好好好  你们牛气  行了吧
Yeah, well, you're -- you're both very pretty, so...

298
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,070
那个...
Well...

299
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,470
你让我做的我做了  没让的我也做了
I believe I did more than what you asked of me,

300
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,500
咱俩这下互不相欠了吧
So, uh, that would make us square, yes?

301
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,110
那就好
Great.

302
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,440
要不要我搭你一程
You need a ride?

303
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,280
野营
Camping?

304
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,270
你觉得我会信这种鬼话吗
You expect me to believe that shit?

305
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,070
我知道你不信
Yeah, I know it.

306
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,930
可是人们有时是这样
The things people do, huh?

307
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,180
我前脚和你说好那事
They decide to go camping

308
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,340
他们后脚就跑出去野营
right after I run my little offer by you?

309
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,290
生活本来就充满了巧合啊
Could be argued that all of life is one great coincidence.

310
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,210
一定是有人让他们去"野营"
Somebody told those people to, um, go camping.

311
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,760
那人给他们提了个醒
Somebody warned them.

312
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,560
他们本来就爱往林子里钻
They're very woodsy.

313
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,500
而且说实话
And between you and me,

314
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,150
他们属于做决定十分冲动的人
they're pretty rash when it comes to the decision-making.

315
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,990
并不是真正懂得深谋远虑的人
I mean, they're not really the plan-ahead types.

316
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,930
如果我是你  就赶紧把那油腔滑调
Yeah, I'd cut the cute attitude right about now

317
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,040
收起来
if I were you.

318
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,980
你出卖了我  是会付出代价的
You ratted on me. There will be consequences.

319
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,270
如果有人警告了凯特尔曼一家
Hey, if somebody warned the Kettlemans,

320
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,970
那也是因为担心那两个孩子
it was probably somebody who was worried about those kids.

321
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,040
你知道你给我惹了多大的麻烦吗
You know how much trouble you caused me?

322
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,640
你被抓住可不是我害得
You didn't need any help getting caught, okay?

323
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,420
邻居认出了你  是你大意了
The neighbor ID'd you. You were sloppy.

324
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,240
不管惹了多大麻烦  都是你自找的
Any trouble you might have -- that's on you.

325
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,600
更别提你车里的血迹了
Not to mention the blood in your van.

326
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,970
你就不能用点清洁剂吗  
Here's a thought -- Ajax, Formula 409!

327
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,020
你根本不知道为了让你出来
You have no idea the tap-dance I had

328
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,230
我跟那些警察兜了多少圈子
to give those cops to get you out of here.

329
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,930
是你给他们拱手奉上一大堆疑点
You gave them probable cause out the wazoo.

330
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,870
即使真的有人
Now, and whoever the somebody is

331
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,750
警告了凯特尔曼一家  让他们离开
who may have warned the Kettlemans got them out of there

332
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,270
你才因此没有做出更蠢的事
before you did anything even more stupid.

333
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,770
那你也应该感谢那个好心人
You should be thanking this good samaritan.

334
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,670
因为不管那人是谁  他帮了你的忙
Because whoever he is, he did you a favor.

335
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:27,550
{\an8}日间美容美甲

336
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,830
我们来按小时计费
Okay, um, I'm thinking hourly here.

337
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,600
由于出现了一些特殊情况
There were some special circumstances,

338
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,510
所以我们的贵宾价
so our elite-tier pricing

339
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,390
为每小时九百五十美元
would be...$950 an hour.

340
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,020
总计二十个小时
Round it off to 20 hours.

341
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,350
一万九千美元
$19,000...

342
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,000
再加上一千美元差旅费
Plus $1,000 for travel expenses.

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,510
咨询费一千五百美元
Consulting fees -- $1,500.

344
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
调研费用
And, uh, research...

345
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,090
立案费五千
Five for filing fees.

346
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,850
外出餐补
I ate on the road.

347
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,650
还有保管费
And storage fees.

348
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,920
各种杂费
Miscellaneous expenses.

349
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,480
我要把我的教会建造在这磐石上
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

350
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,470
{\an8}马太福音16:18

351
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,390
要双排扣还是单排  先生
Double-breasted or single, sir?

352
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,390
单排  我希望你把袖孔开高一些
Single. Now, I want you to cut the armholes high, okay?

353
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,300
-当然  -还有中间要修身一些  修身型
- Of course. - And, uh, trim through the middle -- trim.

354
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,070
要什么布料的
Cloth?

355
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,670
羊毛
Uh, oh, well, uh, wool.

356
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,400
对了
Yeah. Uh...

357
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,420
"特级170塔斯马尼亚羊毛"
"Super 170 Tasmanian wool."

358
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,140
-很好的选择  先生  -谢谢
- Beautiful choice, sir. - Thanks.

359
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,760
海军蓝  好吗
Navy, all right?

360
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,370
就是它  非常好  细条纹的
Oh, that's it. Perfect. Pinstripe.

361
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,680
是不是该讨论衬衫了
Shall we discuss shirts?

362
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,930
好  我要你们这里最好的海岛棉面料
Okay, I'm gonna need your finest sea island cotton

363
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,710
白色圆角领和翻边袖口
with a white club collar and french cuffs.

364
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,810
我这里正好有
I have the very thing.

365
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,880
我认为你还想看看领带吧
And I'm assuming you want to see some ties?

366
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,010
对  我预想差不多应该是
Yeah, I was, you know, picturing something in a --

367
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,060
浅蓝色的针织领带
a light-blue knit.

368
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,310
还有请确保
Oh, and, uh, could you make sure

369
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,440
衬衫上是真正的珍珠母纽扣  好吗
those are real mother-of-pearl buttons on the shirts, okay?

370
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,210
不要那些假的塑料玩意
None of this fake plastic crap.

371
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,260
当然  我马上回来
Of course. I'll be right back.

372
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,300
给这位先生倒杯咖啡  大卫
Some coffee, David, for the gentleman?

373
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,230
找到了
Here we are.

374
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,910
要试试吗
Shall we?

375
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,030
好  来吧
Yeah, let's go.

376
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,470
你怎么想
So, um, what do you think?

377
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,700
{\an8}披头士的一首歌  以梦幻感闻名

378
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,700
-"永远的草莓地"色吗  -对
- "Strawberry fields forever"? - Mm.

379
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,130
{\an8}绚丽色彩

380
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,710
不对  你疯了吗
No. Are you crazy?

381
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,310
-边都沾不上  -是一样的
- N-not even close. - Yes, it is.

382
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,080
-看啊  -不不
- Look. - No, no.

383
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,920
"闪亮黄樟色"更像  像多了
It's way more "Sassafras glow" -- way more.

384
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,430
好好看看  就是"永远的草莓地"色
Use your eyes -- Strawberry Fields Forever.

385
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,850
女士们  帮我看看  这是"闪亮黄樟色"
Ladies, back me up. Hey. Is it -- sassafras glow.

386
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,540
-我对吗  -对  不对
- Am I right?  -Yeah. No.

387
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,980
或者"金色狂想曲"  不过  看到了吗
Maybe "Rhapsody in blonde," but...yeah, see?

388
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,150
她们同意我说的
They agree with me.

389
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,770
人们不是常说"顾客永远是对的"吗
Whatever happened to "The customer is always right"?

390
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,910
闪亮黄樟色  去配吧  好吗
Sassafras glow -- mix it up, all right?

391
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,220
你错了  你会看到的
You're wrong. You'll see.

392
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,160
那有什么关系  大不了我明早洗掉
Big deal. I'll wash it out in the morning.

393
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,310
-多大点事啊  -这是漂发
- No biggie. Geez. - It's bleach.

394
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,140
-洗不掉的  -什么
- It doesn't wash out. - What?

395
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,090
是永久性的吗
It's permanent?

396
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,460
那我们还是直接修图吧
We'll photoshop the color, okay?

397
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,680
计划有变  女士们
Change of plan, ladies.

398
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,390
我只要做简单的烫卷
I want to go with a simple curling-iron job, okay?

399
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,390
给我做那种小卷发
Uh, give me, like, ringlets --

400
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,840
{\an8}1960年版的《斯巴达克斯》

401
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,840
就像《斯巴达克斯》里面托尼·柯蒂斯那种
You know, on top, like Tony Curtis in "Spartacus."

402
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,710
对  就像《斯巴达克斯》里浴室那场戏那样
Yeah, like the bath scene in "Spartacus."

403
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,400
对  那个"我是斯巴达克斯"
Okay. "I am Spartacus."

404
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,230
别再议论了
Stop talking about it!

405
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,480
快让我变漂亮
Make me beautiful, already.

406
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,390
喂
Hello.

407
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,820
这里是詹姆斯·M·麦吉尔先生的律所
You've reached the law offices of James M. McGill, esquire,

408
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,240
一位值得你信赖的律师
a lawyer you can trust.

409
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,920
请在响声后留下你的信息
Kindly leave your information at the tone,

410

麦吉尔先生会尽快给你回电
and Mr. McGill will phone you promptly.

411
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,000
是我
Hey. Uh...it's me.

412
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,040
《怪形》这周六上映
Anyway, uh, "The Thing" is playing downtown on Saturday.

413
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,040
我觉着你应该会喜欢库特·拉塞尔的表演
Thought you might be up for some Kurt Russell action.

414
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,650
我欠你个人情  那要不先吃晚饭
I owe you one, so why don't we just grab some dinner first?

415
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,400
我请
My treat.

416
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,870
要是...你不想来的话
And...uh, you know, if not,

417
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,020
也给我回个电话好吗
can you give me a call anyway?

418
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,450
我真的很想跟你谈谈
I really want to talk to you.

419
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,030
就这样  再见
Okay. Uh, bye.

420
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,690
请进
Come in.

421
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,810
事情怎么样了
How goes it?

422
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,590
有点棘手
Tricky, for sure.

423
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,950
克雷格和贝茜让我们在警察面前的处境很不妙
Craig and Betsy really put us in a corner with the police,

424
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,070
更不用说媒体方面了
Not to mention the press.

425
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,910
但是  他们的野营一说
But this camping story of theirs --

426
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,040
倒是编的无懈可击
they've been keeping it consistent, at least.

427
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,170
如果你同意的话
If it's okay with you,

428
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,880
我觉得应该劝他们雇一家公关公司
I think I should try to talk them into hiring a P.R. Firm --

429
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,110
应付接下来的几周
certainly for the next couple of weeks.

430
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,290
所以  你同意吗
So, okay on the P.R. Firm?

431
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,520
-你现在有空吗  -当然有
- Do you have a minute? - Yeah, of course.

432
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,780
有什么事吗
What's up?

433
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,360
跟我出去兜个风
Take a ride with me.

434
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,460
好的  可是  去哪里兜
Uh, okay. Uh... where are we going?

435
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,820
操
Shit.

436
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,840
是啊
Yep.

437
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,220
他穿的是...我的西装  对吧
That's...I mean, that's my suit, right?

438
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,880
是我疯了吗
Am I crazy here?

439
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:14,040
{\an8}詹姆斯·M·麦吉尔  律师

440
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,350
你没疯
No, you're not crazy.

441
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,430
你看那个标志  那是我们的商标
Look at the logo. That's our logo.

442
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,880
他根本就是在抄袭我们
He's just straight-up copying us.

443
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,870
他脑子里到底在想什么啊
I mean, what the hell is he thinking with this?

444
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,660
我真的  他...他行事不羁
I really -- h-h-he's, you know, a free spirit.

445
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,470
说的也是
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

446
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,670
你俩还是朋友对吧
You two are still friends, right?

447
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,380
-关系不是很  -但还是能说上话的
- I wouldn't exactly -- - You talk, though.

448
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,610
不...怎么说
Not...really --

449
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,980
但他找到凯特尔曼一家
Still, you're the one he called

450
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,060
在桑迪亚斯露营的时候  他打电话给你了
when he found the Kettlemans camped halfway up the Sandias.

451
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,050
他只是想为自己的委托人开脱罢了
He was just looking out for his own client -- that's all.

452
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,120
金  我不是严刑逼供你
This isn't the Third Degree, Kim.

453
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,910
我...我不在乎你们俩关系好不好
I-I really don't care one way or the other.

454
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,870
我只是...
I just...

455
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,970
他这么做太狠了
He's really forcing my hand here.

456
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,940
我打扰到你了吗
Am I interrupting?

457
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,190
没有  来得正好  来来
Not at all. Perfect timing. Come on.

458
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,500
请坐
Sit.

459
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,260
做个按摩吧  免费的
Have a massage, free of charge.

460
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,310
-好啊  -这个足浴也要体验一下
- Okay. - Got to try the foot bath, too.

461
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,040
这把老骨头终于可以歇歇了
Give the old dogs a rest.

462
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,350
要调到深度按摩模式  不然的话
A-and go for the deep-tissue setting. Otherwise --

463
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,440
是这个小的吗
Is that the small fist?

464
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,740
你得用那个  三个箭头那档
Use the -- it's three arrows.

465
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,710
-是啊  我按了那个  -就  对了
- I did. I pressed it. - Just -- yeah.

466
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,340
你现在感觉到了吗  好吧
Now you feel it? Good.

467
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,730
-现在放松试试  -好的
- Now relax, okay? - Okay.

468
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,290
你得休息一下犒劳自己
You deserve a break today.

469
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,370
-真的很舒服  -我早说过了
- It's very nice. - Told you.

470
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,420
我每晚都能免费享受
I get this free every night --

471
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,870
这就是住在美容院里的好处之一
Just one of the perks of salon living.

472
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,760
-其他好处是  -你看  有免费黄瓜水喝
- The others being... - Free cucumber water, obviously.

473
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,060
当然  有免费的修甲吗
Obviously. Free mani-pedis?

474
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,880
修甲享超低折扣
Deep discount mani-pedis.

475
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,000
毕竟人家还是要吃饭的
Because the ladies still got to eat, you know?

476
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,130
好吧  那还是不错的
Well, it's still a deal.

477
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,230
看来你活得很滋润啊
Living like a king, then.

478
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,170
这是什么  是禁止令吗
What's this? Is this a cease and desist?

479
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,820
-是的  -好吧
- Yeah. - Yeah.

480
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,040
他有多生气
How pissed was he?

481
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,660
至少头没气炸
Well, his head didn't actually explode,

482
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,830
但是  还是气得够呛
But, you know, pretty damn pissed...

483
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,910
直骂"你肯定没好下场"这种
...like "This won't end well for you" pissed.

484
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,090
-那又如何  -吉米
- How about that? - Jimmy.

485
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,030
-这不是闹着玩的  -我知道
- This is serious. - I know.

486
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,390
-你真的知道吗  -当然
- Do you?  I mean, - Yeah.

487
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,310
那块广告板到底是怎么回事啊
what the hell is with that billboard?

488
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,690
我知道你跟哈姆林过不去  但我
I know you have a problem with Hamlin, but I

489
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,110
我不懂你那是什么意思
I just don't get your angle here.

490
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,340
你不是要建自己的律所吗
Aren't you trying to build your own law practice?

491
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,790
但你现在花了一大笔钱
Instead, you're spending god knows how much money

492
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,100
把自己变成了哈姆林翻版
turning yourself into a little Hamlin clone.

493
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,400
你干嘛要针对他
I mean...why are you making this personal?

494
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,980
-没有针对他  -明明就是
- It's not personal. - It is so personal.

495
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,480
这完完全全就是针对他
It is completely and totally personal.

496
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,540
-不  都说了不是了  -是  明明就是
- No, no, no. It's not. No. - Yes. Yes, it is.

497
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,100
别再装了
Stop trying to pretend.

498
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,160
我就不能做广告了吗
I can advertise, can't I?

499
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,240
什么  难道我做什么事都要
What, do I have to clear everything

500
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,180
-经过万能的霍华德同意吗  -对
- Past the great and powerful Howard? - Yes,

501
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,030
你可以做广告  吉米  随你
you can advertise, Jimmy, all you want.

502
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,770
但那广告牌不是广告宣传
That billboard is not advertising.

503
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,360
那是宣战
That is a declaration of war.

504
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,720
宣战  那...
Declaration of war? That's...

505
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,780
它就在哈姆林出口
It's right at Hamlin's exit.

506
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,560
你知道他每天都开车从那过
You know he drives by it every day.

507
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,640
那是生意  我在创建一个品牌
It's business. I'm building a brand.

508
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,520
你是剽窃别人的品牌
You're ripping off a brand.

509
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,130
那个广告里一点原创的东西也没有
There is nothing original in that ad.

510
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,470
它绝对代表不了吉米·麦吉尔
It certainly doesn't represent Jimmy McGill.

511
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,250
你听好了  是他打响了第一枪
Hey, all right, now, he fired the first shot, okay?

512
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,550
不许我用我自己的名字  金
Trying to keep me from using my name, my own name, Kim?

513
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,760
我理解
I get that.

514
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,750
但  你可以做得更好
But this... you're better than this.

515
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,980
-我可以做得更好  -对
- I'm better than this? - Yeah.

516
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,840
-我可以做得更好  -对
- I'm better than this? - Yes.

517
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,830
-我更好  -对
- I'm better? - You are.

518
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,260
你比那个蠢哈姆林强
Well, you're better than that schmuck Hamlin!

519
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,460
-拜托  吉米  -你...
- Oh, come on, Jimmy. - You -- hey.

520
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,770
-拜托  -你可以在任何地方工作
- Come on. - You could work anywhere.

521
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,360
你可以在欣赏你的公司工作
You could be somewhere where they appreciate you --

522
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,200
在能看到你价值的公司工作
You know, where they see how valuable you are,

523
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,610
他们会关心你
Where -- I don't know -- maybe they care about you?!

524
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,900
别想了  好吗
Forget it, okay?

525
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,180
如果哈姆林要对付我
If Hamlin wants to come after me,

526
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,590
他知道我在哪
he knows where I am.

527
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,060
我会准备好  全副武装
I'll be ready, guns blazing.

528
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,300
禁止令只是个开始
The cease and desist is just the beginning.

529
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,250
下一步就是强制令
The next step is an injunction.

530
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,790
这场战争你是赢不了的
You can't win this fight.

531
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,760
法官大人  我是卑微的个体律师
Your honor, I'm a humble solo practitioner,

532
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,920
只想在这个充满竞争
merely trying to ply my trade

533
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,640
且日新月异的市场里有一席之地
in an aggressive and evolving marketplace.

534
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,250
正如我不断重申的  这是商标侵权
As I've argued repeatedly, this is trademark infringement.

535
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,890
麦吉尔先生的新商标完全是抄我们的
Mr. McGill's new logo is an absolute copy of ours.

536
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,350
我认为这是合理使用
I think it falls firmly under fair use.

537
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,290
合理使用
Fair use?

538
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,420
你明显从中获利  这不是合理使用
You're clearly profiting, so fair use doesn't apply.

539
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,400
字体就那么几种
It -- there are only so many fonts out there.

540
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,430
难道都属于哈姆林先生吗
Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?

541
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,410
不  但我们用这种字体
No, but we've been using this particular font

542
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,660
已经十二年了
for 12 years now, and it,

543
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,630
还有我们的三矩形图案
in concert with our tri-rectangle graphic

544
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,590
和哈姆林靛蓝  共同组成了注册商标
and hamlindigo blue, constitutes a trademarked brand identifier.

545
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,940
等等  你说啥
Whoa, whoa. Back up.

546
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,750
哈姆林靛蓝
Hamlindigo blue?

547
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,640
对
Yes.

548
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,370
那是我们注册的名字
That is our trademarked name.

549
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,580
天啊
Holy crap.

550
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,410
你真的管一个颜色叫"哈姆林靛蓝"
You seriously named a color "Hamlindigo"?

551
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,680
真是  哇
That is -- yikes.

552
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,660
"哇"  从一个穿着和我一样的人嘴里冒出来
"Yikes"? From the man dressed exactly like me.

553
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,630
法官大人  我感觉
Your honor, I feel like

554
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,200
我在和格劳乔·马克思做镜子表演
I'm in the mirror routine with Groucho Marx,

555
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,200
{\an8}美国喜剧演员

556
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,650
我们应该站着  向对方挥手
like we should be standing, waving our arms at each other.

557
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,650
真的吗  我可看不出来
Really? I don't see it.

558
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,410
另外  出现在两个商标上的名字麦吉尔
In addition, the name McGill appears in both logos,

559
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,150
我认为  麦吉尔先生是想
which, I believe, Mr. McGill is hoping

560
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,530
让潜在客户更加迷惑
to further confuse potential clients.

561
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,760
所以我连自己的名字都不能用吗
So I can't advertise under my own name now?

562
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,030
就因为恰巧和他们律所的一个合伙人
I'm to be penalized 'cause I happen to

563
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,290
名字相同  就要被处罚吗
share a name with one of HHM's partners?

564
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,440
你不能不让我用自己的名字
You can't take my name from me.

565
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,920
名字不是现在的问题  麦吉尔先生
The name is not the problem here, Mr. McGill.

566
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,370
哈姆林先生显然认为是问题
Uh, Mr. Hamlin certainly seems to think so.

567
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:06,860
他想让我改名  因为他声称
I mean, he wants me to change my name 'cause he claims that --

568
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,260
这对他的事业造成了一些威胁
that -- what -- it's some kind of threat to his business?

569
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,380
法官大人  这是贸易管制
Your honor. This is restraint of trade, okay?

570
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,250
现在不是自由市场吗
Whatever happened to the free market, huh?

571
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,810
不  哈姆林是想告诉你...
No, Hamlin here wants you to tell --

572
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:18,750
好  够了  麦吉尔先生  我听够了
Okay, Okay, I've —- enough. Mr. McGill, I've heard enough.

573
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,800
好  你有权利
All right, yes, you are within your rights

574
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,660
用你自己名字做广告
to advertise using your own name.

575
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,330
但是  根据我的判断  这个广告牌明显
However, in my estimation, the billboard clearly

576
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,690
有意抄袭了
and intentionally duplicates elements

577
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,940
哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所的商标
of the Hamlin Hamlin & McGill logo.

578
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,300
你是主动抄袭他们已成立的品牌
You're actively copying their established brand

579
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,600
谋求个人利益
for your own gain.

580
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,490
我不认为还有其他合理解释
I don't see any other reasonable explanation.

581
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,170
-法官大人  我...  -吉米  吉米
- Your honor, I -- - Jimmy, Jimmy.

582
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,650
放聪明点
Wise up.

583
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,080
这个广告牌必须在四十八小时内拆除
The billboard must come down within 48 hours.

584
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,870
这就是经典的弱者对巨人的故事
This is a classic David vs. Goliath story.

585
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,710
他凭借自己庞大的律所
I mean, you got your gigantic law firm

586
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,000
践踏所有小公司
stomping all over the little guy.

587
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,080
对  但这都可以算做黑幕报道了
Yeah, but it's investigative journalism at its best.

588
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,170
这正是你的拿手好戏
I-it's right up your alley. Uh-huh.

589
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,520
好吧  我把我的号码给你  如果...
Yeah, o-okay, well, let me give you my cell just in case...

590
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,810
好  谢谢
Uh -- yeah. Thank you.

591
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,710
请接新闻采编部
Can I get the news desk, please?

592
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,000
我有个大爆料
I got a hot tip.

593
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,340
你难道不想成为搞倒大律所的电视台吗
Don't you want to be the station that brought down big law?

594
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,810
你可以像那些搞倒大烟草公司的记者一样
You could be like the reporters that brought down big tobacco.

595
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,180
就像伍德沃德和伯恩斯坦揭露水门事件那样
Look, I'm talking Woodward and Bernstein here.

596
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,780
你关于自动取款机乱收费的曝光  非常棒
Hey, your exposé on predatory ATM fees -- that was... wow!

597
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,620
这是误判
Well, it's a miscarriage of justice,

598
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:38,050
我觉得你们的读者会非常乐意
and I think your viewers would be very, very interested

599
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,750
并感激你曝光这种不公正行为
and, uh, grateful to you for exposing this injustice.

600
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,810
我觉得这没危及到社区健康
I wouldn't characterize this as a community health risk,

601
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,740
但肯定跟社区利益有关
but it's definitely in the community interest.

602
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,680
不  没错
No, yes,

603
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,870
哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所是社区支柱
HHM is a pillar of the community, yes.

604
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,420
不  斗争也是很重要的故事
No, I -- the war is an important story, as well.

605
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,840
所以这种行为很过分
That's why this action is so egregious.

606
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,380
当然  行
Sure. Okay.

607
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,140
至少要报导地有点人情味
Well, at least consider the human-interest angle here.

608
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,310
你在逗我吗
Are you kidding?

609
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,360
律师自己白手起家
It's -- lawyer pulls himself up by his bootstraps,

610
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,780
结果被家族大律所踩在脚下
only to be ground under the heel of the old-money megafirm?

611
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,670
那是《心灵与智慧》的情节  喂
That's Hearts and Minds! You -- hello?

612
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,750
是  我也有你的号码
Yeah, I have your number, too, so...

613
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,160
我懂了
Yeah, I see.

614
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,340
{\an8}新墨西哥大学

615
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,410
行
Okay.

616
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,060
{\an8}新墨西哥大学  媒体实验室

617
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,850
别  别  别碰  伙计
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, man.

618
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,730
什么都别碰
Can't touch the goods.

619
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,030
我填了表  只有我能碰摄像机
I signed the form -- only I can touch the camera.

620
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,990
行  我建议你扩大画面
Fine, may I suggest you widen the frame to include --

621
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,200
广告牌才是故事主角
The billboard is the story, okay?

622
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,150
我也是故事主角  我也得在里面
No, I'm also the story, so...got to get me in there.

623
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,700
站在标记上
Okay, so, get on your mark.

624
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,700
我对你捉襟见肘的摄影经验没意见
You know, uh, no offense to your minutes of experience,

625
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,410
但开始之前我还是得看看
but I'd like to see what we got before we do this, okay?

626
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,680
那家伙
Other guy.

627
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,730
那家伙
Other guy.

628
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,830
说的就是你  站在我刚站的地方
Only other guy that's here, go stand where I was standing.

629
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,670
蹲一点  蹲一点
Uh...shrink down. Shrink down.

630
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,110
矮一点  好了
You know, scrunch. Yeah.

631
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,320
扩大画面  把广告牌拍进来
Okay, widen the frame. Get the billboard.

632
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,200
好  然后拍我  我  我
Okay, now get me. Me, me, me, me, me.

633
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,370
不是我  拍他  他就是我  就这样
No. Not me -- get him. He's me. Yeah, like that.

634
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,330
-明白吗  -明白
- Got it? - Yeah.

635
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,860
很好
Good.

636
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,250
好  他在镜头里吗
Okay. Is he in the shot?

637
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,990
没有  开始吧
No. Dude, just go.

638
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,630
-我怎么样  -很好看
- How do I look? - Great.

639
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,200
我  不  我这边比较好看
I'll, uh -- no, this is my good side.

640
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,380
-广告牌拍进来了吗  -是的
- Is, uh -- is the billboard in? - Yes!

641
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,590
你说一百美元一小时  不是他妈的三小时
Jesus, just -- you said $100 for one hour, not fricking 3.

642
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,470
你明显有记者的冲动
You clearly have a journalistic impulse.

643
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,400
你真积极  你知道吗
You're a real go-getter, you know that?

644
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,690
快拍
Go get this.

645
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,990
好  我倒数
All right, count me down.

646
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,170
五  四  三
In 5, 4, 3...

647
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,190
要严肃
Gravitas.

648
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,780
我是詹姆斯·麦吉尔
I'm James McGill.

649
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,830
和许多美国人一样  我自力更生
Like most Americans, I'm a self-made man.

650
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:36,670
通过自己努力从法律学校毕业
I put myself through law school.

651
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,010
在法庭当公设辩护律师
Working in the courts as a public defender,

652
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,170
我代理过很多无路可走的人
I represented those with nowhere else to turn.

653
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:45,320
我相信司法体系  这是我事业的基础
I believe in service. It's what I've built my career on.

654
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,520
但我也有梦想  很多人共有的梦想
But I've also had a dream, a dream that many of us have --

655
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,300
自己创业的梦想
a dream to own my own business.

656
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,930
我精打细算  省吃俭用  终于
Well, I-I scrimped and I saved, and finally,

657
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,170
我买得起那个广告位了
I was able to buy one billboard...

658
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,550
能给我刚开的律所打个小广告
...A tiny foray into advertising for my fledgling law firm.

659
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,940
大家总说
I've always been told

660
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,750
美国遍地是机会
that America is the land of opportunity,

661
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,450
直到今天我还深信不疑
and I believed it...until today.

662
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,830
但广告牌竖起来还不到二十四小时
Not 24 hours after my billboard went up,

663
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,580
一家大公司就对我穷追不舍
a large law firm came after me.

664
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,780
他们说我损害了他们的生意
They said that I was hurting their business.

665
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,080
他们有钱有势  但我只是一个普通人
They're rich. They're powerful. I'm just...one man.

666
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,810
你觉得法庭会站在谁那边
So, who do you think the courts sided with?

667
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,070
现在我的广告位倒下了
So now my little billboard comes down.

668
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,630
我告诉你
Let me tell you something --

669
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,500
如果他们想斗  那我们就斗到底
if they want a fight, they're gonna get a fight,

670
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,900
因为我不会放弃
because I'm not giving up, not --

671
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,830
我的天  你看那人
Holy shit! Dude, the dude!

672
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,890
-救命  -你看那人
- Help! - Dude, the dude!

673
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,540
你看那个工人
The w-- the worker guy!

674
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,760
我的天
Holy shit.

675
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,320
来人啊  救我下去
Please! Aah! Get me down!

676
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,890
-你看那人  -行  快报警
- Dude! - Yeah, okay, call 911!

677
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,980
-救救我  -你有手机吗
- Help me! Aah! - You got a cell?

678
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,440
-有  -救命啊
- Yeah, yeah. - Aah! Please!

679
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,540
有人快要从山南边临街的
Yeah, a guy just fell off a billboard

680
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,910
广告牌上摔下来了
from frontage road south of mountain.

681
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,060
伙计
Hey, man!

682
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,350
救救我
Help me!

683
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,000
我觉得那样不安全
Hey, man, I don't think that's very safe!

684
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,130
你得有执照才能上去吧
You need to be, like, licensed for that!

685
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,110
-救救我  -天
- Help me! - Man.

686
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,060
别往下看
Not looking down.

687
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,030
一次一级
One rung at a time.

688
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,030
别往下
Not looking down.

689
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,830
快点
Hurry up!

690
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,700
快来救我

00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,350
救救我
Help me! Aah!

693
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,250
-先生  我就在这里  -救我
- Sir, I'm right here! - Please!

694
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,850
求求你
Please!

695
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,790
-拉我上去  -抓住我的手
- Pull me up! - Here, grab my hand!

696
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,110
拉我上去
Pull me up!

697
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,690
-拉我上去  -抓住
- Pull me up! - Here!

698
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,800
你没事吧
You okay?

699
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,460
动作怎么那么慢
Took you long enough.

700
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,770
{\an8}解救工人
本地英雄律师

701
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,860
是  我当时吓死了
I was scared, yes.

702
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,630
其实我还是
I mean, I'm not really a big fan of heights --

703
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,230
有点恐高
Let me tell you.

704
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,190
但我内心有个声音说  "必须救人"
But, you know, something inside me said, "You have to do this."

705
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,740
我觉得就算没有我
I'm sure our city's first responders

706
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,870
急救人员也会及时到场
would have been here momentarily.

707
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,740
天啊  你相信这家伙吗
Oh, jesus, can you believe this guy?

708
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,060
但至少我的出现让大家安了心
But at least I was able to provide a reassuring presence.

709
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,930
这简直就是在做秀  肯定是这样
This whole thing was a publicity stunt. It's got to be.

710
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,810
我觉得一人有难时
I think that's kind of all anybody wants

711
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:41,880
都希望别人伸出援手
when they're in trouble.

712
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,080
当然  我不认为人生...
You know, of course, I didn't think that life...

713
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,060
不会有人信吧
You don't think anyone's gonna actually buy this?

714
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,980
...会在生命攸关之时
...was gonna call on me in such an immediate

715
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,050
-向我求助  -很难说  人们喜欢英雄
- And, life-threatening way. - It's hard to say. People love a hero.

716
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,730
...都会毫不犹豫  是吧
...take it as it comes, right?

717
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,750
我身处当时那种情况
The universe put me in that spot at that moment.

718
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,230
怎么会拒绝
Who am I to say no?

719
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,700
作为一名律师  我每天都在帮助他人
You know, as a lawyer, while I help people every day,

720
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,320
可能不受这么多关注
I may not get as much attention for it.

721
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,890
这就是做秀
Whole thing's a damn stunt.

722
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,210
但我觉得我的委托人
But I think my clients know

723
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,150
都知道他们有难  我都会帮忙
that when they're in trouble, I'm there.

724
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,700
我只是在对的时间...
I was just a guy who was in the right...

725
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,160

It's just showmanship, Chuck.

730

Did you --

733
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,260
是  我放电了  今天很棒
Yeah, I grounded myself. Hey, big day.

734
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,330
我电话响个不停
My phone's ringing off the hook.

735
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,810
上午有三个咨询  三个哦
I have three consults before lunchtime -- three.

736
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,350
太棒了  吉米
That's great, Jimmy.

737
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,010
咸鱼翻身了
Yep. The worm has turned.

738
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,520
真的很不错
Oh. That's really great.

739
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,870
你觉得突然改善的原因是什么
So, to what do you credit this sudden change?

740
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,510
我承认  你说得对
Well, I got to admit -- you were right.

741
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,800
为什么
How so?

742
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,760
你叫我继续努力
Well, you told me to keep plugging

743
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,120
干好活儿  委托人不请自来
and, uh, you know, do good work, and the clients will come.

744
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,730
我承认
You know, I'll -- I'll admit,

745
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,800
我有几次差点丢失信念  但我咸鱼翻身了
I almost lost faith a couple times, but the worm has turned.

746
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,040
你公设案的委托人
So, uh, what -- you've been getting referrals

747
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,780
给你推荐客户了吗
from your P.D. clients?

748
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,820
没错
Uh, yeah.

749
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,330
工作努力  向别人证明你脑子还不错
You know, you work hard, show you got half a brain,

750
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,520
人们就会像你说的那样上门
and people come knocking, like you said.

751
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,660
我现在只需做好宣传
I just needed to get my face out there.

752
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,810
检察官有推荐委托人吗
So, prosecutors, then -- referring clients?

753
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,940
当然有
Yeah. Yep. Exactly.

754
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,860
是伯杰龙吗
Was it Bergeron?

755
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,550
我刚起步时  她把我推荐给几个好客户
When I was starting out, she sent me a couple good ones.

756
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,180
没错  其实
Yeah, uh, it was --

757
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,990
是她一个手下推荐的
It was someone on her team you know?

758
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,030
肯吃苦耐劳  不要不三不四
I mean, hey, just took some elbow grease and clean living --

759
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,430
人们就会注意你
People noticed.

760
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:30,040
我就知道你有潜力
I knew you had it in you.

761
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,860
今天的报纸呢
I don't see the journal here.

762
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,270
对
Right.

763
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,610
-在这里  -不  不
- Here you go. - No, no, no.

764
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,400
《阿尔布开克日报》不见了
Uh, Albuquerque Journal -- it's not here.

765
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,400
外面我也没看到
Oh, yeah. I didn't see it outside.

766
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,680
没在外面吗
Wasn't out there?

767
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,890
-总在外面啊  -我没看到
- It's always out there. - I didn't see it.

768
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,350
可能忘记投递了
Maybe they forgot to deliver it.

769
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,760
可能有小孩拿走了
Maybe some kids grabbed it.

770
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,210
那个小孩肯定非常喜欢
Because if there's one thing kids love,

771
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,050
本地的报纸
it's local print journalism.

772
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,110
我不知道怎么说
I don't know what to tell you.

773
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,170
但你有一堆可以读的东西
You got a ton of reading material there.

774
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,940
你看  《金融时报》
Look, hey. Financial Times.

775
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,420
我知道阿尔布开克是国际事务的中心
You know, I know Albuquerque is a hub of global intrigue,

776
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,640
-但这个应该够你读了吧  -好吧  行
- but you think that'll tide you over? - All right, fine.

777
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,710
但如果明天还没有
But if it's not here tomorrow,

778
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,910
你得帮我打给订阅办公室
I'm gonna need you to call the subscription office for me.

779
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,410
行  我会的  我得走了
Yeah, will do. Look, I got to go.

780
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,420
我不想迟到
I don't want to be late.

781
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,290
祝你好运
Hey, good luck today!

782

你努力工作的样子很棒
Hard work looks good on you.
