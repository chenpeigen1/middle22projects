谢谢你来接我
Thanks for coming.

22
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,080
不谢  应该的嘛
Oh, yeah, of course.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,280
我的车就停在街对面
I'm just parked across the street, so...

Okay. I...I was just gonna hit the...

爷爷有点累了
Pop-pop's getting tired.

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,870
别闹啦
Don't "Aw" Me.

34
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,650
你也稍微歇歇吧
You take a little break -- little break.

35
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,720
自己玩会儿吧
Go on.

36
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,730
真是个好孩子
A good kid.

37
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,400
是啊  她挺乖的
Yeah, she is.

38
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,940
你觉得...
So, how do you like it...

39
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,550
大西部怎样啊
out west?

40
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,290
挺好  我喜欢广阔的天地
I like it. Wide-open spaces.

41
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,350
好吧
Yeah.

42
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,700
反正和之前是不一样了
Different, anyway.

43
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,900
是啊
Yeah.

44
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,420
你最近咋样
How you doing?

45
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,730
我...还好吧
I'm -- yeah, I'm okay, you know?

46
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,130
还在适应
Adjusting.

47
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,330
凯莉呢
And Kaylee?

48
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,130
她也在慢慢适应
Yeah, she's settling in.

49
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,070
她还会时常问起他...
She still asks about him --

50
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,530
问"爸爸在哪儿"
"Where is daddy?"

51
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,490
她很想他
She just misses him.

52
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,590
好吧
Yeah.

53
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,830
你准备待多久  麦克
How long you in town for, Mike?

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,440
我在这儿...
I'm here...

55
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,200
会一直待下去
for the duration, indefinitely.

56
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,890
我...好多了
I'm, uh -- I'm better.

57
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,960
抱歉让你们等了这么久
And I'm sorry it took me so long.

58
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,490
我跟以前不一样了  这次是真回来了
But I'm not like I was. I'm back. I'm solid.

59
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,200
我想陪着你  凯莉  我的家人
I want to be here for you, for Kaylee, for my family.

60
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,680
那就好  你没事就好
That's good. I'm glad to hear you're better.

61
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,700
咋了
What?

62
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,640
你想说什么  亲爱的
What is it, honey?

63
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,530
麦克  我得问清楚...
Mike, I got to ask --

64
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,160
我知道我得向前看了
I mean...I know I just need to move on from this,

65
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,610
但有件事我一直很纠结
but I keep thinking about something.

66
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,180
纠结什么
About what?

67
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,630
就在马蒂死前
How, before Matty died,

68
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,760
几个礼拜
like, for a few weeks there,

69
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,890
他...性情大变
he was...different.

70
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,750
怎么变了
Different how?

71
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,010
我也说不清
Different -- I don't know.

72
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,250
变得喜怒无常
Moody, you know?

73
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,810
他基本上啥也不吃  也不睡觉
He barely ate. H-he wasn't sleeping.

74
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,090
因为鸡毛蒜皮的小事就跟我吵架
He snapped at me about the stupidest things.

75
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,320
我以为他是工作不顺
I started to think something's up at work

76
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,230
或是有人病了什么的
or -- or someone's sick, something like that,

77
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,650
但他不愿跟我说  把自己封闭了起来
but he wouldn't talk to me. He clammed right up.

78
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,020
警察嘛  不愿吐露心事  你也知道
Cops aren't real touchy-feely. You know that.

79
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,830
没错
No.

80
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,880
你说得也是
They're not. No.

81
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,430
但这不是什么"男儿有泪不轻弹"
But this wasn't the normal "Tough guys don't cry" crap.

82
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,490
这里头肯定有问题...  你没发现吗
This was more. I mean... did you notice?

83
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,800
你没发现他的转变吗
I mean, did you feel anything like that from him?

84
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,850
没...  我没看出来
I don't -- as far as I remember, he seemed okay.

85
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,340
我觉得他挺正常的
He seemed okay to me.

86
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,460
我后来想着...  我...
Well, I started to think -- I'm --

87
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,310
我都不知道该怎么想
I don't know. I didn't know what to think.

88
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,360
之后...  他死前大概三四天吧
But then...three days or -- or four --

89
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,700
我记不太清了
I don't remember --

90
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,460
凌晨两点半电话响了
But before he died, there was this phone call.

91
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,010
我醒了  发现马蒂没在床上
2:30 in the morning, I wake up, and Matty's not in bed.

92
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,660
我听见他在楼下说话
And I hear him. He's talking downstairs.

93
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,280
我就躲在楼梯上偷听
So...I go to listen on the stairs, where he couldn't see.

94
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,010
他当时很生气
He gets intense.

95
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,450
尽管他在低声说话
Like, he'd be screaming

96
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,300
但好像随时会大叫  你知道吗
if he wasn't whispering, you know?

97
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,210
马蒂很少生气的  他总是看得很开
Matty didn't get worked up. He'd let things go.

98
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,650
但这次不一样  他非常生气
But -- but this -- I mean, he was angry.

99
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,390
他真的非常生气
He was really angry.

100
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,790
他当时在说什么
What was he saying?

101
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,730
我听不太清楚  是关于...
I couldn't make it out. It was something about...

102
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,060
我不知道  我听不清
I don't know. I couldn't hear it.

103
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,780
但第二天早上  我问他
But the next morning, I called him out --

104
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,980
"昨晚怎么了  发生什么事了"
"What the hell was that about? What's going on?"

105
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,030
可他不肯跟我说
And he wouldn't talk to me.

106
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,880
但我想...
But I think...

107
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,840
我想他是在跟你说话
I think he was talking to you.

108
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,580
我吗
Me?

109
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,090
还会有谁呢
I mean, who else?

110
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,070
有那么一刻
For one hot second,

111
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,750
我想他是不是有外遇了
I thought maybe he was catting around --

112
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,000
不  他不会那样做的
No, he wouldn't do that.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,070
是的  我知道  但是你...
No, I know. I know that. But you --

114
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,750
他知道如果有困难随时可以找你
He knew he could call you anytime he had a problem.

115
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,040
你们俩那么亲密无间
You were thick as thieves, the two of you.

116
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,790
他的声音有些奇怪
And there was something in his voice.

117
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,350
他说话的方式
It was... how he was talking.

118
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,600
让我觉得他就是在跟你说话
It makes me think it was you.

119
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,580
史黛西  我想那不是我
Stace, I don't think it was.

120
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,790
我不记得跟他有过深夜谈心
I can't recall any late-night heart-to-hearts with him,

121
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,900
那个时候没有
not around then.

122
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,160
可能是他的线人或者什么案子
Maybe it was a C.I. or a case.

123
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,270
听我说
Listen.

124
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,580
我知道你在做什么  一遍又一遍回想
I know what you're doing -- replaying it over and over,

125
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,940
想着  "如果我当时意识到了什么
thinking, "If I'd noticed this or changed that,

126
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,780
也许结果就不会是这样"
maybe I could have done something."

127
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,430
你觉得我没这样想过吗  我也有
You don't think I haven't had those thoughts? I do.

128
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,420
每天都在想
Every day.

129
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,710
你不能再这样自责下去了
You got to quit beating yourself up like this.

130
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,450
马蒂不在了
Matty's gone.

131
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,450
就是这样
That's really all there is to it.

132
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,330
是啊
Yeah.

133
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,700
我想是吧
I guess that's that.

134
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,440
时候不早了
It's getting on.

135
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,450
我该去给凯莉做晚饭
I got to...get Kaylee her dinner

136
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,840
哄她上床睡觉了
and put her to bed.

137
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,710
是啊
Uh, yeah.

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
好吧
Okay.

139
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,100
如果你需要我过来照看她  我...
Well, if you want me to drop by and keep an eye on her, I...

140
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,700
我愿意帮忙
I want to help.

141
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,780
回头见
See you around.

142
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,770
去哪
Where to?

143
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,730
{\an8}出租车驾驶员许可证

144
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,400
你叫弗朗西斯科
"Francisco."

145
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,930
是我
Yeah.

146
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,270
你很了解这个小镇吗
You know this town?

147
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,470
是的  当然
Yeah, sure.

148
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,350
有多了解
How well?

149
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,680
这是你自己缝的吗
You sew this up yourself?

150
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,810
还不赖
Not bad.

151
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,460
这里肯定有个故事吧
Bet there's a story there.

152
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,540
-每个伤口背后都有故事  -是的
- Isn't there always? - Yeah.

153
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,250
好了  疼一下
All right. Little sting here.

154
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,800
好了  应该可以了
Okay. That ought to do it.

155
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,870
现在...
Now...

156
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,990
不要剧烈运动
...you're gonna want to take it easy.

157
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,850
保持清洁
Keep it clean.

158
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,480
保持干燥  慢慢就愈合了
Keep it dry. Let it heal.

159
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,450
在路易斯安大道那边有个沃尔格林[药店]
There's a Walgreens a couple blocks over on Louisiana.

160
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,240
可以去那里买一个悬带
Maybe go get yourself a sling.

161
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,060
你这里没有吗
You don't have one?

162
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,440
抱歉
Sorry.

163
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,190
-有套在脖子上的喇叭筒  -我知道
- Got a cone you can put around your neck. - Yeah.

164
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,540
都差不多  是吧
It's about the same, right?

165
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,930
五百块钱是吗
So, it's gonna be $500?

166
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,400
五百块
$500.

167
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,570
我可以给你一点止痛药
I can, uh, throw some pills in for the pain.

168
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,320
这药是维柯丁[止痛药]
This stuff's essentially vicodin.

169
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,000
二十五块一颗卖给你
I can give it to you for $25 a pill --

170
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,060
少给十块也行
Maybe drop the price to $15

171
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,950
这药毕竟不是给人吃的
for something a little less human-centric.

172
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,710
我吃点阿司匹林就行
I'm an aspirin man.

173
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,920
这样吧  送你几片
Tell you what -- take a couple on the house.

174
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,480
说不定你就想吃了呢
in case you change your mind.

175
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,730
你是这儿新来的吧
You new in town?

176
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,000
是的
Yeah.

177
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,530
是路过还是要待一阵
Passing through or sticking around?

178
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,320
怎么了
Why?

179
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,000
就是问问
No reason.

180
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,640
如果你想搬来迷人之地[新墨西哥州]
It's just, if you're relocating to the Land of Enchantment,

181
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,740
我倒是认识些人
I know people.

182
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,770
可以给你找份工作
I could get you some work.

183
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,740
那种工作我可不要
I am not looking for that kind of work,

184
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,280
不过  还是谢谢你
but -- ohh -- thanks.

185
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,830
真不明白为什么要搞成这样
Don't know why it has to be this way.

186
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,730
在你家好好地谈不行吗
Could have been friendly. Could have talked in your house.

187
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,210
你真要走正式流程吗
You really want the formal treatment?

188
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,960
我要律师
Lawyer.

189
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,880
行了  麦克
Come on, Mike.

190
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,240
就问你几个问题而已
It's just a couple of questions.

191
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,400
没什么大不了的
ain't nothing but a thing.

192
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,000
我要律师
Lawyer.

193
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,080
你又没被捕
You're not under arrest.

194
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,150
谁说你"被捕"了吗  没有
Okay, did anybody here say "Arrest"? No.

195
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,850
你想走就走
You want to walk, walk.

196
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,120
我原以为你会很配合的  
I got to say, I, uh, expected more cooperation from you on this,

197
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,960
你我都是警察嘛
cop to cop.

198
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,090
我要律师
Lawyer.

199
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,600
好吧  哪位律师
Fine. What lawyer?

200
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,500
{\an8}要立遗嘱吗  找麦吉尔

201
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,460
我找厄门绍特  谁知道他在哪
Ehrmantraut -- who's got him and where?

202
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,050
那边
That way.

203
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,350
伙计们  最近还好吗
Hey, fellas. How you doing?

204
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,300
我是詹姆斯·麦吉尔  来见我的委托人
James McGill -- Here to see my client.

205
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,010
怎么了
What?

206
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,070
{\an8}马特洛克  美剧《至尊辩护律师》的主角
由安迪·格里菲斯饰演

207
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,100
-你看着真像马特洛克  -才不是
- You look like Matlock. - Uh, no,

208
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,530
应该是像扮成马特洛克的青年保罗·纽曼[演员]
I look like a young Paul Newman dressed as Matlock.

209
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,400
我的委托人在哪
Where's my guy?

210
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,670
{\an8}《安迪·格里菲斯秀》里的人物

211
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,670
你的巴尼·法伊夫来了
Say hello to Barney Fife.

212
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,800
不是同一个剧  不过谢谢
Wrong show, but thanks for playing.

213
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,410
你怎么了
So, what happened --

214
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,630
是不是市长给你的贴纸不够啊
The mayor didn't give you enough stickers?

215
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,020
告诉我这是怎么回事吧
You want to tell me what we're doing here?

216
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,270
这是你的咖啡
Oh, here's your coffee.

217
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,440
希望是滴滴香浓意犹未尽
Hope it's good to the last drop,

218
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,810
因为我要为它收你一小时服务费
'cause I'm billing you the full hour for it.

219
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,060
这是给你的
That's for you.

220
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,400
你倒挺贴心
That's very thoughtful.

221
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,040
你真不喝吗
You serious?

222
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,980
你为什么要让我带咖啡来
Why did you have me bring it to you?

223
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,500
听我说  一会儿你要这么做
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

224
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,180
外面那俩警察是从费城来的
Those two cops out there are from Philadelphia.

225
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,440
他们是专程来找我的
They've come a long way to see me.

226
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,190
他们进来以后
When they come in here,

227
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,730
我要和他们聊几句
we're all gonna have a little chat.

228
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,370
等我们聊完以后
And when it's over,

229
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,300
那位之前一直在做笔记的年轻警察
The young one, who's been writing in his little notebook,

230
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,180
就会拿起笔记本  放进他的夹克衫里
He's gonna take it and put it in his jacket.

231
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,690
他放好笔记本以后
And when he does that,

232
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,180
我要你拿着这杯咖啡  泼到他身上
I want you to take that coffee and spill it on him --

233
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,680
制造点小意外  就这样
Little accident, that's all.

234
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,140
我为什么要泼人家
And w-why, pray tell, would I do that?

235
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,250
因为我让你这么干
Because I'm asking you to.

236
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,050
你是我叫来的
It's the only reason you're here.

237
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,450
所以说  我在这儿是因为你想让我袭警
So I'm here because you want me to assault a police officer.

238
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,130
我是让你从这杯微热的咖啡里弄点出来
I am asking you to take a few ounces of lukewarm coffee

239
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,700
泼到他身上
and spill it on him.

240
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,450
这还构不成"袭警"吧
I doubt that satisfies the definition of "Assault,"

241
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,590
我的大律师
but, hey, you're the lawyer.

242
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,780
好吧  我也真是傻了
Right. How silly of me.

243
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,990
你就是想让我给你打掩护
All you want is for me to aid and abet

244
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,490
因为你想偷人家的笔记本
you ripping off that guy's notepad,

245
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,460
你来这儿就是要干这个  对吧
'cause that's what you're doing here, right?

246
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,290
你疯了吗
What -- are you nuts?

247
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,810
你开国际玩笑呢
You can't be serious.

248
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,840
你可别忘了  你还欠我个人情呢
Hey, I hate to remind you of this, but you owe me one.

249
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,680
一家人失踪的事我帮了你
The assist I gave you with the missing-persons problem --

250
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,380
你懂得礼尚往来吗
one good turn and so forth?

251
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,000
你想要回报吗  这就是我给你的回报
You want a good turn? Here's your good turn, okay?

252
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,420
我会做一个
I'm gonna behave

253
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,100
诚实守信  遵纪守法的执业律师
like an honest-to-god, law-abiding, licensed attorney,

254
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:22,590
因为你显然需要一个
'cause, clearly, you need one

255
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,420
能帮你解决这里问题的律师
with whatever the hell is going on here.

256
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,830
走廊里那两个家伙
Now, those two jokers out in the hallway --

257
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,760
我会保证他们不漏掉一丝细节
I'm gonna make sure they dot their I's and cross their T's --

258
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,050
一切都开诚布公
everything square and above board.

259
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,500
这才是我要做的
That's what I'm gonna do,

260
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,020
我来帮你  你开心还来不及
and you're gonna be happy as hell that I'm here.

261
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,840
用胡安·瓦尔德兹咖啡干坏事  不行
But this little Juan Valdez bump-and-dump -- no.

262
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,840
{\an8}胡安·瓦尔德兹  哥伦比亚咖啡公司的虚拟代言人

263
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,540
我才不帮你
Not gonna happen.

264
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,940
先生们  我们准备好跟你们谈了
Hey, gentlemen, we're prepared to indulge you.

265
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,170
按照警局要求  埃斯卡莱拉警探要来旁听
Detective Escalara will be sitting in with us, as per APD policy.

266
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,630
你没问题吧
Okay with you, right?

267
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,870
我没问题
Fine with me.

268
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,540
行
Okay.

269
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,680
你有律师了  麦克  能说了吗
You got your lawyer, Mike. Can we talk already?

270
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,740
很好  我们说过
Great. So, like we said,

271
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,150
我们在调查霍夫曼和芬斯基的案子
we're here looking into this Hoffman and Fensky thing.

272

什么都可以说  任何信息
Yeah, and whatever you can tell us -- anything at all.

273
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,210
慢着
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

274
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,450
"霍夫曼"  "芬斯基"
"Hoffman." "Fensky."

275
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,170
说详细点
Fill me in.

276
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,370
就当我对委托人的情况一概不知
Assume I know absolutely nothing about my client here, all right?

277
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,400
-重新开始  -天  开玩笑吗
- Start at the beginning. - Jesus. Seriously?

278
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,330
别被厄门绍特先生闪烁的双眼
Look, don't let Mr. Ehrmantraut's dancing eyes

279
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,590
和热情达观的性格骗了
and bubbly, bon vivant personality fool you.

280
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:28,610
信不信由你  其实他不爱说话
He's actually -- believe it or not -- somewhat taciturn.

281
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,660
要不给你们扇会儿风吧  免得你们休克了
Shall I fan you gently, so you don't go into shock?

282
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,370
重新开始  行吗  从最开始说起
Start at the beginning, okay? We're talking Book of Genesis.

283
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,610
行  麦吉尔先生  你应该知道了
Okay, Mr. McGill, as you probably gathered,

284
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,070
我和桑德斯警探
we -- Detective Sanders and I --

285
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,190
在费城警察局工作
work for the Philadelphia Police Department,

286
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,680
厄门绍特先生也在那工作近三十年
as did Mr. Ehrmantraut for nearly 30 years.

287
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,910
费城  加油  费城老鹰[橄榄球队]
Philadelphia? Go, eagles.

288
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,600
厄门绍特先生有个儿子叫马特

289
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,270
他之前也是费城警局的
He, too, was with Philly P.D.

290
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,400
当时还是个刚工作两年的新人
He was a rookie officer with about two years on the job.

291
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,910
他是个好警察
He was a good cop.

292
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,120
确实
Yes, he was.

293
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,100
大概九个月前  他接到报警
About nine months ago, he responded

294
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,610
西区有间破房子里有枪击
to a shots-fired call in some west side rattrap.

295
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,240
马特和他的搭档特洛伊·霍夫曼警官一起去的
Matt went in with his partner, officer Troy Hoffman.

296
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,760
杰克·芬斯基警长是他们的后援
They had Sergeant Jack Fensky backing them up.

297
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,360
不幸的是  事情失去控制
Unfortunately, things got out of hand.

298
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,990
他们三人中了埋伏
The three of them were ambushed,

299
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,150
马特没能活着回来

霍夫曼和芬斯基回击了
Hoffman and Fensky returned fire,

301
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,610
但开枪的人跑了

302
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,400
我们跟进了一些线索  找了些嫌疑人
We chased a few leads, shook up the usual suspects --

303
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,650
但毫无进展
came up short.

304
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,420
很抱歉听到这些
I'm very sorry to hear it.

305
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,610
总之  我们兜兜转转
Anyways, we kept beating the bushes,

306
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,220
查无所获  直到三个月前
kept coming up dry until three months ago.

307
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,750
霍夫曼和芬斯基被发现
That's when Hoffman and Fensky both turned up dead

308
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,670
死在城北一片空地上
in a vacant lot out in nicetown --

309
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,520
好像又是中了埋伏
again, an ambush of some kind, it looks like.

310
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,320
这个杀了马特却逍遥法外的人
And with whoever killed Matt out there in the wind,

311
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,890
我们觉得  合理地推测
we're thinking -- well, it's our operating theory

312
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,200
霍夫曼和芬斯基肯定卷入了什么事
that Hoffman and Fensky were mixed up in something,

313
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,280
结果出了岔子  导致马特被杀
some bad business, and maybe that got Matt killed.

314
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,610
抱歉  我得尽我律师的职责问一下
Yeah, sorry. I got to do my lawyer thing here.

315
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,260
这和我的委托人有什么关系
Uh, what does my client have to do with any of this?

316
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,840
麦克  这是孤注一掷
Uh, Mike, this is a Hail Mary.

317
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,930
或者说大海捞针
Uh, beyond that.

318
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,380
要是证据确凿  线索可信
I mean, if we had any hard evidence or leads,

319
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,780
我们也不会找你
we wouldn't be out here.

320
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,310
霍夫曼和芬斯基卷入了什么事情
Now, there's anything you can tell us

321
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,840
你有什么想说的吗
about what Hoffman and Fensky were into?

322
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,240
帮帮我们  麦克
Yeah, help us out, Mike.

323
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,760
帮我们抓住杀了马蒂的混蛋
Help us catch the bastard who killed Matty.

324
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,710
霍夫曼和芬斯基我不太熟
I don't know much about Hoffman and Fensky.

325
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,800
他们是马特的同事  我看见过他们几次
They were Matt's people. I'd see them around sometimes.

326
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,450
他们被杀当晚  我看到他们在一个酒吧里
I saw them in a bar the night they died.

327
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,590
是麦克卢尔酒吧
It was Mcclure's --

328
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,270
那条红色狗很可能是麦克卢尔的
Maybe the red dog -- Probably Mcclure's.

329
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,210
他们当时和谁一起喝酒
Were they drinking with anyone?

330
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,350
是一个警察常去的酒吧
It's a cop bar.

331
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,530
他们和所有人一块儿喝酒
They were drinking with everyone.

332
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,600
你看见他们和什么特别的人在一起吗
Yeah, but did you see them with anyone in particular?

333
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,430
我不知道  我当时...
I couldn't tell you. I was...

334
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,270
你知道我当时的情况
You know how I was.

335
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,310
你近来过得怎么样
How you doing these days?

336
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,020
感觉就像是从瓶底爬出来
Feeling like I crawled out from the bottom of a bottle

337
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,930
努力不再落回去
and working hard to stay there.

338
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,090
我不得不说
Although I've got to say --

339
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,790
挖我的过去是没什么用的
Doesn't help much, dredging up the past like this.

340
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,420
那我问你
Let me ask you,

341
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,190
你是什么时候来阿尔布开克的
when did you come out here to Albuquerque?

342
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,910
不会是过了很长一段时间吧
It couldn't have been, uh, too much later.

343
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,550
就是在第二天到的
I think it was the very next day.

344
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,620
就是霍夫曼和芬斯基死亡的第二天吗
Yeah? The day after Hoffman and Fensky died, huh?

345
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,470
你听说这件事以后没想过留下来吗
You didn't think to, stick around once you heard the news?

346
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,590
我是过了堪萨斯城才听说的
I don't think I heard the news till I was west of Kansas City.

347
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,410
那你也
Still, you, uh --

348
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,600
你也没回来参加葬礼对吗
You didn't come back for the funerals, correct,

349
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,540
即使霍夫曼是马特的搭档
even though Hoffman was Matt's partner?

350
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,440
你还记得酒吧那一晚的事吗
Do you remember anything about that night at the bar?

351
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,830
你那时和霍夫曼或芬斯基说过话吗
Did you talk to Hoffman or Fensky at all?

352
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,920
抱歉  我不知道  我们不共事
Sorry. I got nothing. They weren't my people.

353
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,280
很遗憾你们把宝压在我身上
I'm sorry you guys took a flier on me.

354
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,940
希望对你们有帮助
I wish it'd have paid off.

355
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,610
就这样  我们可以走了吗
That it? We done here?

356
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,730
好了  没我们事了
We're done here, yeah.

357
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,680
也不是什么难事对吧
Hey, that wasn't so hard, huh?

358
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,410
-谢了  麦克  -不客气
- Thanks, Mike. - Yeah.

359
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,280
听着  我们可能会在附近待几天
Listen, we're probably gonna kick around for another couple of days,

360
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,930
你如果想到什么就告诉我们
in case you think of something, all right?

361
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,680
正好我以前从没来过西部
I've never been out west before.

362
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,920
见鬼
Oh! Oh, shit!

363
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,410
-天哪  抱歉  -搞什么啊
- Jesus. Sorry. Sorry. - Come on!

364
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,720
-过来  我来帮你  -有纸巾吗
- Here. I can get most of it. - You got any paper towels?

365
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,370
那个  我来就好了
You know what? Hey, hey. I-I got it.

366
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,070
-我来  谢谢  -抱歉
- I got it. Thank you. - Sorry.

367
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,240
看在...
For the love of...

368
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,980
你确定要看吗  就在我眼前
You got to do that right here, right in front of me?

369
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,370
里面记着什么重要内容  非得让我们
What's so important in there that we had to pull

370
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,650
用这种不入流的马克斯兄弟的手段
that third-rate Marx Brothers routine?

371
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,650
{\an8}美国的戏剧团体  热衷于塑造癫狂或装傻充愣的人物

372
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,880
你真想知道
You really want to know?

373
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,820
冒着妨碍司法的风险  还是算了吧
And risk getting a piece of an obstruction rap? No, thank you.

374
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,300
你还有什么想问的
Anything else you want to ask?

375
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,200
你是怎么知道的
How did you know?

376
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,380
知道什么
Know what?

377
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,640
刚刚我会那么做
That -- that I would do that, that --

378
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,370
你怎么知道我刚刚会
How did you know that I would,

379
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,290
泼咖啡
spill that coffee?

380
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,460
你笑什么
What the hell's that?

381
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,940
你什么意思
What's supposed to mean?

382
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,870
行  你是高冷硬汉
Okay, great. You're the strong, silent type.

383
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,220
好样的
Hooray for you.

384
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,080
但我还是要提醒你
But in case you missed it,

385
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,830
你那两个费城来的朋友
your friends from Philly back there --

386
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,690
他们认为是你杀了两个警察
They think you killed two cops.

387
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,620
我知道
Yep.

388
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,980
{\an8}警官保罗·格兰特  无消息

389
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,640
{\an8}时间  
晚十点  芬斯基/霍夫曼

390
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,350
{\an8}马特死亡

391
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,310
{\an8}一周后  麦克退休
三个月后  史黛西搬到阿尔布开克

392
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,080
是我
Yeah, it's me.

393
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,390
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

394
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,970
你叫的警察
You call the cops?

395
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,310
-什么  -费城警局  是你报的警吗
- What? - Philadelphia P.D. -- did you call them?

396
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,130
-是  是我  -为什么
- Y-yeah, I did. - Why?

397
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,020
我告诉他们我听说了
Well, I told them I heard about

398
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,310
霍夫曼和芬斯基的事
Hoffman and Fensky--

399
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,440
还有什么
And what?

400
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,950
你不觉得这很奇怪吗
And you don't think it's strange?

401
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,630
先是马特
First Matt,

402
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,350
然后不到六个月  他的搭档和队长也出了事
then not six months later, his partner and his sergeant?

403
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,160
是我打电话让他们帮忙抓到杀死马蒂的凶手
Yeah, I called them to help catch Matty's killer.

404
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,950
麦克  如果是同一个人呢
Mike, what if the same person,

405
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,850
要是那个杀死马蒂的人
if the -- what if the piece of shit who got Matty

406
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,200
也杀死了那两个人呢
got them, too?

407
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,950
你到底和他们说了什么
And what exactly did you tell them?

408
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,310
-我告诉他们  -你告诉他们马特不干净
- I told them -- - You tell them Matt was dirty --

409
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,770
-你是这么告诉他们的吗  -我...
- Is that what you told them? - I --

410
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,390
你怎么能那么想
How could you possibly think that?

411
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,330
那是你丈夫  你孩子他爹
That's your husband, the father of your child.

412
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,290
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

413
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,340
我...我告诉他们我发现了钱
I s-- I told them I found money.

414
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,680
凯莉和我搬到这里后  我在拆箱时
After Kaylee and I moved here, when I was unpacking,

415
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,140
在一个老箱子的内层里发现的
it was in the lining of an old suitcase.

416
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,380
肯定是马特藏的  因为大概有
Matt must have tucked it away in there, 'cause this was cash --

417
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,810
五六千现金  不知道哪来的
$5,000, $6,000 from God knows where.

418
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,010
我们都是吃工资的
I mean, we were basically paycheck to paycheck.

419
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,550
他哪来的钱
Where the hell did he get it?

420
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,930
你为什么不来问我
Why didn't you ask me?

421
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,820
你为什么不来找我
Why didn't you come to me?

422
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,120
我不能找你
I couldn't.

423
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,020
我知道这样会让你很难办
I knew what it would do to you.

424
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,120
他先是被杀了
First, he's murdered,

425
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,920
然后又会让你觉得...
and then for you to think...

426
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,030
这会让你身败名裂的
I-it would have burned you to the ground.

427
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,710
你就什么都没了
There would be nothing left.

428
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,530
而且你也不跟我说话
And you wouldn't talk to me.

429
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,420
你每晚都喝得酩酊大醉
Every night, you were drinking yourself unconscious,

430
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,100
好像只有你失去了他似的
like you were the only one who lost him.

431
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,870
我不在乎他到底手脚干净不干净
Look, I don't care. He was dirty, he was clean

432
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,060
我不在乎
I don't care.

433
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,750
我只想让杀害马蒂的人
All I want is for whoever killed Matty

434
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,050
下半辈子都在监狱里度过
to rot in a cell for the rest of their life,

435
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,330
而且死后被人扔垃圾堆里
and then I want whatever's left of them

436
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,980
这就是我全部的念想
just dumped in the trash -- that's what I want.

437
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,310
我不管会牵扯出什么  有什么内幕
I don't care where it leads, what it uncovers.

438
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,580
我是说  就算他有什么见不得人的
I mean, what difference would it make

439
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,220
又有什么区别呢
if he was...anything?

440
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,330
我还是爱他
I'd still love him.

441
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,570
我还是想他  他已经死了
I'd still miss him. He'd still be gone.

442
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,040
马特是干净的
Matt wasn't dirty.

443
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,100
那就把话跟我说明白
Well, so be straight with me!

444
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,360
马上  告诉我  麦克
Right now. This is it, Mike.

445
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,330
他死之前那通电话到底是怎么回事
What was that phone call before he died?

446
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,380
不要糊弄我
Don't bullshit me.

447
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,570
那是我跟我儿子之间的事
That was between me and my son.

448
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,690
所以你承认是你打的
So you're admitting it was you.

449
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,290
他是干净的
He wasn't dirty!

450
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,560
你他妈的  你给我记清楚了
God damn you! You get that through your head!

451
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,680
我儿子是干干净净的

让他自个儿哭去吧
Just let him cry it all out, okay?

455
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,340
老麦
Hey, Mikey.

456
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,140
-小霍夫曼  -麦克兄
- Young Hoffman. - Mikey boy.

457
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,000
-最近怎么样  兄弟  -你好吗
- What's going on, my brothers? - How you doing?

458
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,360
兄弟对吧
Brothers, huh?

459
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,340
我也很高兴见到你  好久不见了
Good to see you, too. It's been a minute.

460
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,080
我知道  我知道是你们俩
I know. I know it was you.

461
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,840
要打烊了  老麦
Closing time, Mikey.

462
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,920
要不我送你回家吧
Hey, how about I give you a lift home?

463
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,160
我没事
I'm fine.

464
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,540
不行  我不能让你开车  给你叫个车吧
No, I can't let you drive. Get you a cab?

465
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,740
不用了  我好着呢  好着呢
No, I'm good. I'm good.

466
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,270
别担心
Don't worry.

467
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,080
我把车都卖了  只有走路了
Anyway, I sold my car, so I'm walking.

468
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,720
谢谢
Thank you.

469
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,590
新墨西哥州  阿尔布开克
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

470
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,470
你去过吗
You ever been?

471
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,740
没去过
Nope.

472
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,550
我马上要去那儿
Well... that's where I'm headed.

473
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,870
那边有狼蛛
Tarantulas, they got.

474
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,640
我肯定不敢去
That's a big minus in my book.

475
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,360
我会小心的
Well, I will be on the lookout.

476
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,470
你要保重  朋友
You take care, my friend.

477
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,200
保重
Take care.

478
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,480
麦克
Hey, Mike.

479
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,090
老麦
Mikey.

480
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,660
要搭个便车吗
You want a ride?

481
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,390
我自己走路
I'll walk it.

482
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,380
在前面停车
Pull over here.

483
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,300
你在外面做什么呢
What are you doing out here?

484
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,790
来吧  我们载你一程
Come on. Let us drive you.

485
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,770
这外面比我前妻奶头还冷
It's colder than my ex-wife's tit out here.

486
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,490
来吧  来吧
Come on. Come on.

487
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,490
我自己走
I'm walking.

488
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,210
来吧  别闹了
Come on. D-don't be an ass.

489
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,590
来吧  我们带你回家  上车来吧
Come on. Let us take you home. Get in the car already.

490
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,740
外面很冷的
It's cold out here.

491
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,260
怎么啦  来吧  麦克  快上车
What? Come on, Mike. Come on.

492
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:04,460
上车
Come on.

493
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,540
好啦  慢点
Okay. Easy.

494
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,380
我们马上送你回家
We're gonna have you home in no time.

495
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,790
老天
Oh, god.

496
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,430
你干嘛呢
Hey. What are you doing?

497
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,530
还给我  那是我的
Hey. Give me that. That's mine.

498
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,120
等会儿给你
Later.

499
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,320
万一枪走火了咋办  对吧
We don't want you to shoot your foot off, now, do we?

500
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,060
老麦
Hey, Mikey.

501
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,820
什么
What?

502
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,120
老麦  你还醒着吗
Mikey, you with us?

503
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,680
怎么了
Why?

504
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,960
你刚才真是醉得糊涂了  伙计
You really tied one on good back there, buddy.

505
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,200
可不是嘛  喝那么多酒
Shit, yeah, he did -- put it away like they were

506
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,980
好像明天就要颁布禁酒令了一样
fixing to bring back prohibition.

507
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,430
在麦克卢尔酒吧的时候
Hey, hey, back at McClure's,

508
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,050
你发酒疯说胡话
you were talking out your ass,

509
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,350
"我知道是你们俩"
"I know it was you."

510
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,170
你什么意思
What's that supposed to mean, huh?

511
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,590
你知道些啥
You think you know what?

512
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,710
你有什么憋在心里
You got something you want to get off your chest,

513
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,310
要跟我们说说吗
Something you want to say to us?

514
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,560
你们杀了他
You killed him.

515
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,180
是你们杀了马蒂
You killed Matty.

516
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,590
你们平白无故就杀了他
And you killed him for nothing.

517
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,870
你们害怕他可能会去告发
You killed him because you were scared

518
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,980
所以就杀了他
of what you thought he might do.

519
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,630
你们让他进了那贩毒屋
You got him in that crack house...

520
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,290
你们设计好了的
And you staged it --

521
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,610
看起来像是某个瘾君子开的枪
Made it look like a junkie with a gun.

522
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,160
其实是你们
But it was you.

523
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,970
我知道就是你们
And I know it was you.

524
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,690
我会找到证据的
And I'm gonna prove it.

525
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,700
帮我把他弄出来
Help me get him out of the car.

526
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,630
干嘛
What?

527
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,480
来吧  出来  当心头
Come on. There you go. Watch your head.

528
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,020
好了  来吧  麦克
All right, come on, Mike,

529
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,650
一二一  一二一
One, two, one, two, buddy.

530
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,670
你先在这儿等一会儿
Now, you wait there one second.

531
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,430
我们会好好处理的  好吗  老麦
We're gonna work this whole thing out, okay, Mikey?

532
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,890
我们现在怎么办
What do we do now?

533
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,780
丧子之痛
Grief -- it's a bitch.

534
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,430
马特死于非命  让他难以承受
He couldn't live with it -- Matt dying the way he did.

535
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,310
老麦痛不欲生
It's too much for the old man.

536
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,520
所以决定饮枪自尽
So Mikey here decided to eat his gun.

537
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:29,730
真是太悲剧了  但是没有人会怀疑
It's tragic, but anyone could see this coming.

538
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,250
他本来就醉得只有半条命了
He's drinking himself to death.

539
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,110
我们就算帮他个忙
We're doing him a favor.

540
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,500
聪明  如果是我的话也会这么做
Smart. That's what I would have done if I were you.

541
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,370
麦克  我...
Mike, I...

542
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,040
你选择睁一只眼闭一只眼
You let some things slide and you look the other way.

543
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,840
你逮到一个毒贩
You bust a drug dealer

544
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,290
缴获的现金你一辈子都挣不到
that has more cash than you'll ever earn in a lifetime.

545
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,530
有些钱没有被归入证据上交  那又怎样
Some of it doesn't make it back into evidence -- so what?

546
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,540
你尝到了甜头  每个人都尝到了甜头
You took a taste. So did everyone else.

547
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,980
然后你就觉得自己安全了
That's how you knew you were safe.

548
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,110
就像刺杀凯撒  其实每个人都有份
It's like killing Caesar -- everyone's guilty.

549
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,980
马特没有拿脏钱
Matt wasn't dirty.

550
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,900
我拿了
I was.

551
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,800
那个辖区每个人都拿了
Everyone was in that precinct.

552
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,140
我们就是这样办事的
That's how it worked.

553
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,980
供出你的同伴  等于自寻死路
You turn in your buddy, you're screwing yourself.

554
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,450
你只能随波逐流
You go along to get along.

555
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,730
你随波逐流了
And you went along.

556
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,040
是的
I did.

557
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,200
是啊
Yeah.

558
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,140
是的
I did.

559
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,450
可你说马特没有
Okay. But you said Matt didn't.

560
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,820
对
No.

561
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,660
不是马特
Not Matt.

562
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,120
芬斯基早就找上霍夫曼
Fensky got to Hoffman early --

563
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,800
他们向帮派收取回扣
kickbacks from some gang or another --

564
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,030
也就是保护费
protection, basically.

565
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,350
霍夫曼来找马蒂想拉他下水
And Hoffman went to Matty and offered to cut him in.

566
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,580
挺公平的  不是吗  他们是搭档
Only fair, right? They were partners.

567
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,750
而马特的反应和你想的一样...
And Matt did what you would think --

568
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,610
他很纠结
He agonized.

569
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,040
然后他来找我
And then he came to me,

570
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,820
说要去找内务部
wanted to go to the I.A.,

571
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,280
伸张正义  告发他们
do the right thing, shut 'em down.

572
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,880
我的天啊  你让他去了吗
Oh, my God. And you let him?

573
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,650
这就是他被杀的原因
That's why he got killed --

574
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,580
因为他要告发别人是吗
'Cause he was gonna turn on those guys?

575
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,400
不  不是
No. No.

576
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,340
我对他说...
I told him...

577
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,060
你知道警察最怕什么吗
You know what a cop fears most?

578
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,880
胜过被枪杀  胜过一切
More than getting shot, more than anything?

579
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,570
是坐牢
Prison --

580
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,610
跟你以前逮捕的人关在一起
Getting locked up with everybody you put away.

581
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,270
拿这个威胁一个警察  会让他不择手段
You threaten a cop with that, you make him dangerous,

582
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,320
我就是这么对他说的
and that's what I told him.

583
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,410
我跟他讲道理
I talked sense.

584
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,070
这样大家都可以相安无事
No one was getting hurt.

585
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,280
可如果你去找内务部
But if you go to the I.A.,

586
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,570
哪怕你稍微表现出这种想法...
if you even look like you're going...

587
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,160
他有老婆  有孩子
He had a wife, a kid,

588
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,980
有责任
responsibilities.

589
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,610
接受这笔钱  用它做些好事
Take the money. Do something good with it.

590
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,540
我尽力了
Well...I tried.

591
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,580
我尽力了
I tried.

592
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,150
可他就是听不进去
But he wouldn't listen.

593
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,370
我儿子太倔强了
My boy was stubborn.

594
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,790
太要强了
My boy was strong.

595
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,460
他这样会把自己逼上死路的
And he was gonna get himself killed.

596
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,730
所以我对他说...
So I told him...

597
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,090
我对他说  我也干过这种事
I told him I did it, too,

598
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,850
我和霍夫曼一样  用卑鄙的手段过活
That I was like Hoffman, getting by,

599
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,950
这就是你那晚听到的那通电话
and that's what you heard that night --

600
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,810
我想说服他
me talking him down,

601
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:51,300
他奋力挣扎  最后没了力气
him kicking and screaming until the fight went out of him.

602
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,060
他一直把我当作偶像
He put me up on a pedestal...

603
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,320
所以我不得不向他坦白
...and I had to show him

604
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,840
我和其他人一样一身污秽
that I was down in the gutter with the rest of them.

605
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,450
他崩溃了
Broke my boy.

606
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,870
我把我的孩子弄崩溃了
I broke my boy.

607
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,370
他去找霍夫曼  接受了钱
He went to Hoffman, he took the money,

608
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,850
但他犹豫了
but he hesitated.

609
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,720
即便看上去他照他们两个的吩咐做了
Even looking like you're doing the right thing to those two

610
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,780
他们还是觉得他不可靠  不信任他
meant that he wasn't solid, that he couldn't be trusted.

611
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,410
我让马蒂去接受那笔钱
I got Matty to take the money.

612
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,990
两天后他们就杀了他
And they killed him two days later.

613
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,730
他是我所知道的最要强的人
He was the strongest person that I ever knew.

614
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,630
即使是为了保命  他也不会做出这种事
He'd have never done it, not even to save himself.

615
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,490
是我...
I was the only one --

616
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,730
只有我能让他像那样堕落
I was the only one that could get him to debase himself like that.

617
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,620
结果是徒劳的
And it was for nothing.

618
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,800
我让他变成了懦夫
I made him lesser.

619
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,970
变得像我一样
I made him like me.

620
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,060
到头来那群混蛋还是杀了他
And the bastards killed him anyway.

621
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,050
霍夫曼和芬斯基...
Hoffman and Fensky...

622
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,130
如果马蒂是他们杀的
if they killed Matty...

623
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,610
那是谁杀了他们
Who killed them?

624
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,790
爸  到底怎么回事
Pop...what happened?

625
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,290
你知道是怎么回事
You know what happened.

626
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,800
问题是...
The question is...

627
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,090
你能接受吗
can you live with it?
