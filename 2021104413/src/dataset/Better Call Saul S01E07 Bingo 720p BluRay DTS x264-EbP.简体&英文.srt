这次也都让我来说
Once again... I do all the talking.

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,510
这是唯一可行的方法
That's the only way this works.

21
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,340
拿过来
Hand it over.

22
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,560
在我们交还本子之前
Now, before that happens --

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,330
拿过来
Hand it over.

24
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,710
别这样  东西就在我这
No. Hey. I've got it right here.

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,330
是这个吗
Is this it?

26
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,650
那应该就是了
I'll -- I will take that as a "Yes."

27
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,400
很好  谜团解开了
Very well. Mystery solved.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,000
我现在就可以拘留你们
You know, I could take you into custody right now,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,270
你个混蛋
You son of a bitch --

30
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,900
你俩都是
both of you.

31
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,180
你干嘛这么说
Where's this coming from?

32
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,370
是你把咖啡倒到我身上的
You're the one who spilled the coffee,

33
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,120
你这个丧尽天良的混蛋律师
you ambulance-chasing piece of shit!

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,290
可以稍微冷静一点吗 
Can we dial it down, you know, just a notch?

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,850
听着  四十五分钟前  我睡得正香
Look, 45 minutes ago, I'm sound asleep.

36
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,660
厄门绍特先生给我打了个电话
I get a call from Mr. Ehrmantraut.

37
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,030
他很担心
He's concerned.

38
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,540
因为你在语音留言里威胁他
He's getting threatening voicemails from you

39
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,860
指控他是个贼
accusing him of petty theft.

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,950
我说  "我们可以将问题扼杀在萌芽阶段
I tell him, "Hey, we're gonna nip this in the bud.

41
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,460
不管现在是什么时候
I don't care what the hell time it is.

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,870
我们都可以解决这个问题"
We're gonna go talk this thing out."

43
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,210
而就在我们穿过停车场的时候  就刚刚
And walking across the parking lot, just now -- boom --

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,660
这本子就好端端地躺在柏油路上
there's a notepad, plain as day, lying on the asphalt,

45
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,050
我只能假设是你不小心掉的  警探先生
where I can only surmise you accidentally dropped it, detective.

46
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,870
我们知道的就这些了
Now, guys, that's -- that's all we know.

47
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,640
听着  老滑头
Let me tell you something, slick --

48
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,760
你就等着我把你弄回费城吧
wait till I get you back to philadelphia.

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,790
我不太明白
I'm confused.

50
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,740
宾州难道会因为归还失物
The state of pennsylvania can extradite people

51
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,780
把好人引渡回去吗
for returning lost property?

52
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,630
这法立得不错
That is one bold legislature.

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,740
关于里面的东西你有什么想说的吗
Anything you want to say to me about what you found in here?

54
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,350
现在你什么都知道了
Now that it's all out in the open?

55
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,350
也许你儿媳妇
Maybe your daughter-in-law --

56
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,870
也许她会告诉我们的
maybe she's got something to tell me.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,110
也许
Maybe.

58
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,030
也许不会
Maybe not.

59
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,240
等着瞧
Yeah, we'll see.

60
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,340
明天第一件事
First thing tomorrow...

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,630
你肯定在想  要是她什么都不知道
I mean, you got to figure she wouldn't reach out to us

62
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,150
怎么会主动联系我们
if she had nothing to say.

63
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,080
希望你所做的一切
Hopefully, whatever you are

64
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,480
不会连累到你的家人
didn't rub off on the rest of your family.

65
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,540
谢谢
Thanks.

66
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,520
不客气  我们离开这个鬼地方吧
You're welcome. Let's get the hell out of here.

67
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,890
"谢谢"的意思是  三个人在这太挤了
No, I mean "thanks" as in "Three's a crowd."

68
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,100
你可以走了
You can go now.

69
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,530
我不在场你不能跟我的委托人说话
You're not talking to my client without me.

70
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,080
他可以  请你走吧
Yeah, he is. Please leave now.

71
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,280
你倒过时差吗
Man. You ever have jet lag?

72
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,730
我现在还在倒
I guess that's what this is.

73
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,280
也许是海拔的原因
Maybe it's the altitude?

74
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,550
可能是海拔
Could be the altitude.

75
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,350
这里海拔一千六百多米  是吧
We're a mile up, right?

76
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,760
那孩子  我很抱歉
Sorry about the kid.

77
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,080
他很年轻  正是大展拳脚的时候
He's young, looking to make his mark.

78
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,870
我喜欢他
I like him.

79
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,260
你儿媳妇  她
Your daughter-in-law -- what --

80
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,490
她会和我们说什么呢
what's she gonna tell us?

81
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,920
我真的不知道
I don't honestly know.

82
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,560
麦克  如果她什么都不说的话
Well, Mike, if she's got nothing to say,

83
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,800
这件事就到此结束了
this pretty well ends it here.

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,840
也许你应该在我们找她之前和她聊聊
So maybe you should talk to her before we do.

85
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,420
我和她聊过了
I talked.

86
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,680
我猜  她不会和你们说什么
If I were to guess, I'd say she wouldn't tell you much.

87
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,310
但是
But...

88
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,910
不管怎样  随她吧
Either way, that's up to her.

89
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,940
这是我欠她的
That's the least I owe her.

90
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,720
我们认识的很多人
There's a lot of people we both know

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,360
都觉得芬斯基该死
that think that Fensky got what was coming to him --

92
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,920
霍夫曼也是
Hoffman, too.

93
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,810
那整个辖区就像个下水道
That whole precinct was a sewer.

94
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,830
提早退休的人再多一些也不足为奇
Wouldn't be surprised if there's a few more early retirements.

95
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,210
也许是好事  可以补充新鲜血液
Might be a good thing -- new blood.

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,500
像那孩子一样
Like the kid.

97
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,520
没错
Yeah.

98
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,060
他还好
He's all right.

99
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,920
就是需要些经验
He's just got to learn, that's all.

100
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,660
有些事情  不要拆穿
Some rocks you don't turn over.

101
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,440
你和他说了什么
What did you say to him?

102
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,940
趁你还记得  逐字逐句复述给我听
Let's go, word for word, verbatim, while it's still fresh.

103
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,720
我说了什么不关你的事
What I said is none of your concern.

104
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,330
只是和一个朋友聊聊
I was speaking to a friend.

105
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,020
你是和一个飞了三千两百公里
You were speaking to a homicide detective

106
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,200
来调查一起双重谋杀案的警探聊天
who flew 2,000 miles to investigate a double murder

107
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,100
而且你还是主要嫌疑人
for which you are clearly the prime suspect.

108
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,780
你怎么会不了解他们的小诡计  心理战
How could you not recognize the mind games, the scams,

109
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,160
还有一出出骗局
the -- the con jobs these people play?

110
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,630
你过去也干过  所以你到底说了什么
You used to be one of them. So what got said?

111
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,800
现在就说  我很认真的
Right now, come on. I'm serious.

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,750
我知道你在帮我  但是你不能
I know you're trying to help me, but you can't go --

113
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,030
听着  我是在帮我自己
Look, no, I'm trying to help me.

114
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,530
那两个费城的条子
Those two Philly cheesesteaks --

115
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,810
想把我关在你的隔壁
They want to lock me up right alongside you.

116
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,640
跟我合作  这对我们俩都好
So, work with me here, for the both of us.

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,300
你很安全  律师
You're safe, counselor,

118
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,430
我也不再需要你为我服务了
and I no longer require your services.

119
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,960
开什么玩笑
You're -- you're kidding, right?

120
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,640
你认为可以为自己辩护吗
What -- y-you think you're gonna defend yourself?

121
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
会有别人去做的
It's in someone else's hands.

122
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,040
-谁  上帝吗  -不
- What -- like god? - No.

123
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,810
别告诉我是哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
Please don't say Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill.

124
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,140
很感谢你的帮忙  回家睡觉去吧
I appreciate your help. Go home. Go to bed.

125
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,340
把账单寄给我
Send me your bill.

126
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,390
我会把账单寄给你的
Oh, I'm sending you my bill.

127
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,100
我会寄...
I'm sending --

128
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,090
肯定会寄的
You better believe it!

129
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,110
是我  善良的送冰人
It's me -- your friendly neighborhood ice man.

130
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,530
培根肉卖断货了
There was a run on bacon.

131
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,590
我下次再给你买
I'll get you next time.

132
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,610
查克  你在吗
Chuck, you there?!

133
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,860
查克
Chuck?

134
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,080
查克
Chuck?

135
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,030
查克  你在楼上吗
Chuck, you up there?

136
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,800
有人吗
Hello?

137
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,660
我在外面
I'm out here!

138
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,920
查克
Chuck?

139
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,720
...112, 113, 114...

140
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,770
老天呐  你在干什么
Holy shit! What are you doing?!

141
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,280
...115, 116, 117,

142
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,590
118, 119...

143
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,710
120  走  进屋去
120! Go! Go! Inside!

144
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,700
你在干什么
What the hell was that?

145
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,290
你在干什么
What the hell was that?

146
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,610
让我喘口气
Just give me a second.

147
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,420
好了
Okay.

148
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,160
好了
Okay.

149
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,740
是一项实验  真的
It's an experiment, really.

150
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,430
我正在尝试建立对外界电磁场的耐受性
I've been attempting to build up a tolerance for electromagnetic fields.

151
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,020
-真的吗  -是的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

152
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,220
是的  就好像  你知道的
Yeah, it's like, um, you know,

153
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,020
每天摄入一点毒药  时间一长就有免疫力了
like taking small doses of poison to build up an immunity.

154
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,650
有用吗
Yeah, well, is that a real thing?

155
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,150
因为那听起来好像没用
'Cause that does not sound like a real thing.

156
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,480
真的
It's a real thing.

157
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,400
总之  你也知道的
Anyway, as you well know,

158
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,000
在我家前院西南偏南方向二百米处
there is a 60-kilovolt transformer

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,060
有个六十千伏的变压器
200 meters south-southwest of my front yard.

160
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,510
我一直在让自己去适应它
And I've been trying to get acclimated to it.

161
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,430
我今天整整待了两分钟
I got up to two minutes today.

162
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,530
-天呐  查克  -是啊
- Jesus, Chuck. - Yeah.

163
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,900
两天前  我连三十秒都待不上
Two days ago, I could barely stand 30 seconds.

164
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,080
下周我准备尝试五分钟
I'm trying to get up to five minutes by next week.

165
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,670
那真是...
That is just...

166
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,740
可为什么是现在呢
Uh, but why now?

167
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,500
被警察抓走  又被送进医院
Well, after what happened with the police and the hospital,

168
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,790
我现在几乎什么都没有了  吉米
I almost lost everything, Jimmy.

169
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,400
我不能再这样生活下去
I can't go on like this.

170
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,900
我必须想办法好起来
I have to find a way to get better.

171
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,160
我必须好起来  我要回去工作
I've got to. I have to get back to work.

172
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,190
坐在这里  慢慢腐烂...
Sitting here, rotting away --

173
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,720
这不是我该过的生活  谁都不该这样生活
This is no kind of life for me -- for anyone.

174
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,900
我必须重新做回一个有用的人
I need to be useful again.

175
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,280
查克  我真为你骄傲
Chuck... I am so proud of you.

176
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,060
这个过程将会很漫长
It'll be a long process,

177
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,490
但是我坚信自己一定会做到
but one to which I'm very much committed.

178
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,840
我必须做到
I have to be.

179
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,290
天呐  我马上回来
God, I -- I'll be right back.

180
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,040
-我去车里拿点东西  -好的
- I got to get a few more things out of the car. - All right.

181
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,900
很好
All right.

182
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,210
这是什么
What's all this?

183
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,510
只是一些卷宗  办公室里没地方放了
It's just some case files. I'm out of room at the office.

184
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,110
我不想把它们放在车上
I don't want to leave them in the car.

185
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,310
这里有很多敏感信息
There's a lot of sensitive information.

186
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,310
你不会是打算把东西放在这里吧
Y-you're not planning to leave them here.

187
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,250
-是啊  -可能不行  吉米
- Yeah. - I don't know. Jimmy.

188
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,260
不会放太久的  好吗
It'll just be for a little while, okay?

189
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,270
我那里已经堆满了  我都没地方睡觉了
I'm practically sleeping on these things back at my place.

190
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,370
生意那么好吗
Business is that good?

191
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,400
简直太兴隆了  遍地是黄金
It's booming -- streets of gold.

192
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,330
放心  我会尽快把这些东西弄走的
Yeah. I'll get these out of here as quick as I can.

193
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,130
我要为一些遗嘱增添四章十三条的内容
I just need to file the 4-13s on some of these wills,

194
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,210
然后就不会再来打扰你了
and, uh, I'll be out of your hair.

195
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,500
四章十三条
4-13s?

196
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,540
个人财产声明
Personal property statements.

197
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,990
那是五章十三条
You mean 5-13s.

198
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,390
对  抱歉
Yeah. Sorry.

199
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,690
我总跟这些老年人一起工作
I was just working with these seniors.

200
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,690
可能老年痴呆也会传染吧
Maybe the dementia's contagious, huh?

201
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,820
我们说好了  明天老时间见
So, uh, we good here? See you tomorrow. Same time.

202
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,980
我是詹姆斯·麦吉尔
James McGill,

203
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,840
斯科特说会留下801室的钥匙
Scott said he'd leave the keys to 801,

204
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,510
那间出租套房
the suite that's for lease.

205
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,980
给你  看完之后给我就行
Here you go. Just bring them back when you're done.

206
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
好的
You got it.

207
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,910
这里看起来  真的很不错
Wow, this is, like... really nice.

208
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,760
怎么听起来那么惊讶
Why do you sound surprised?

209
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,390
不惊讶  不
Not...surprised, no.

210
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,810
只是  你付得起租金吗
Just, you know, could you afford this?

211
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,150
当然了  开什么玩笑
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?

212
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,560
那些老人对我特别好
Those seniors have been very good to me.

213
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,370
我打算扩大规模  知道吗
I've been meaning to expand, you know?

214
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,380
是时候为自己投资了
It's time to invest in myself.

215
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,590
我觉得这里再适合不过了
Figure this may be just the place.

216
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,790
你不会想念那个美甲店吗
Well, won't you miss the Nail Salon?

217
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,980
我又不是不能回去了
Oh, I can always visit,

218
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,250
说不定还做个法式美甲呢
you know, get some french tips.

219
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,040
这是间清水房
It's a clean slate.

220
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,430
接待处就设在这儿
Put the, uh, reception desk right here.

221
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,260
摆些舒适的沙发给我的委托人坐
Uh, get some comfortable seating for the clients.

222
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,180
真大啊  装得下好多办公室呢
I-it's big -- lot of offices.

223
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,320
是啊  我就喜欢大空间
Yeah, I like the openness.

224
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,760
这样我才觉得呼吸顺畅
I feel like I can breathe in here, you know?

225
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,750
不像那些窄小幽闭的屋子
It's not some claustrophobic, little closet.

226
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,660
闻着一股丙酮的味
That smells like acetone.

227
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,750
这里发展空间很大
Room to grow.

228
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,390
人就是要敢想
Dream big, I say.

229
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,750
大小恰到好处的会议室
Got a decent-size conference room --

230
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,890
虽然没有哈姆林律所那么大  但很舒适
not as big as Hamlin's, but, you know, it's cozy.

231
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,080
我们的老年同胞一定会喜欢的
Our elderly brethren prefer that, I find.

232
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,430
是啊  不过还能搞得再舒适些
Yeah. Could be cozier, though.

233
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,720
你可以弄些刺绣垫子
Maybe you could embroider some little cushions,

234
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,710
织条漂亮桌布
crochet a runner for the table.

235
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,010
-周围摆上摇椅  -没错
- And rocking chairs all around? - Yes.

236
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,800
{\an8} 美国家庭口味连锁餐馆

237
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,800
弄的像老饼干餐馆那样的前厅
Make it look like the front of a Cracker Barrel, huh?

238
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,840
就该这样
Now you're talking.

239
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,150
这是我的办公室
This is me.

240
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,190
真棒啊
I love it.

241
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,960
想要成功就得先看上去成功  对吧
Got to look successful to be successful. Am I right?

242
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,090
没错  看起来是挺成功的
Well, this definitely looks like success.

243
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,550
视野真好
Great view.

244
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,160
在这里摆个宽大的办公桌
Get you a big, fancy desk in here.

245
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,830
要黄檀木桌
Cocobolo desk.

246
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,560
-什么桌  -我也不知道那是什么
- A what? - I don't know what it means,

247
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,210
但我就喜欢说"黄檀木"这三个字
But I just like saying the word "Cocobolo."

248
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,850
好吧  不管是什么桌  都是你应得的
Okay, well, whatever it is, you deserve it.

249
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,330
我还想让你看看这儿
And, uh, I want you to see this one.

250
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,800
就这间
Here we are.

251
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,550
这间比那间好多了
This is way better than the other one.

252
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,720
-是吗  -是啊
- You think? - Uh, yeah.

253
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,690
这是给谁的屋子
Who goes in here?

254
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,090
我要是你  肯定选这间当办公室
'cause I'd be all up in here if I were you.

255
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,770
嗯
Yeah.

256
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,040
这屋子确实不错
Yeah, you know, you're right. It is real nice.

257
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,340
这是转角办公室  你得坐转角办公室
It's a corner office. You got to go with the corner office.

258
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,810
我其实是想把这间留给别人的
Eh, I was saving it for someone.

259
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,650
-给谁  -我的合伙人
- Who? - Well, my partner.

260
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,100
你的合伙人  那是...
Your partner? Who's...

261
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,030
会是谁呢
Who would that be?

262
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,460
你之前不是说对老年法很感兴趣吗
Well, you said you were interested in Elder law.

263
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,360
这...
That's...

264
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,720
这也太...
That is so...

265
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,990
谢谢  真的谢谢你
Thank you. Really.

266
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,120
可我为哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所付出了很多
But you know I've got a lot invested at HHM.

267
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,370
照目前的情况看
With what's going on now,

268
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,230
我非常有可能成为合伙人
I-I'm closer than ever to partner --

269
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,080
也许两年以后  我就是了
Like, maybe two years, and I'm in.

270
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,750
我知道
Yeah, I know.

271
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,840
我只是这样想想而已
Yeah, it's -- it's just a thought.

272
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,010
而且  他们还供我去法律学校读书
Plus, you know, they put me through law school.

273
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,420
我欠他们人情
I feel like I owe them.

274
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,540
实际上我还欠他们钱
Actually, I do owe them -- literally, you know?

275
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,200
不过还是谢谢你想到我  吉米
But it's a nice thought, Jimmy.

276
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,300
你知道的  我就是喜欢胡思乱想
Just, uh, you know, playing with ideas.

277
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,950
多了一间办公室  所以就...
So, I had the extra office and everything, so...

278
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,450
我知道
Yeah. No, I get it. It's...

279
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,600
我想看看厨房
I...want to see the kitchen.

280
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,370
居然是不锈钢的
They have stainless in here.

281
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,670
我家都不是不锈钢
I don't even have stainless at home.

282
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,510
这些话你们可能不想听
I know this is the last thing you want to hear.

283
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,630
但我认为  陪审团不太可能
I think your chances of getting a

284
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,450
给出有利于我们的裁决
favorable ruling from a jury are very slim.

285
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,350
什么意思
What does that mean?

286
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,600
我们没有绝对把握胜诉
We're not in a great position to win at trial.

287
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,870
但我们雇你们
But we came to you people

288
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,320
不就是因为你们说能打赢官司吗
because we were told you win cases.

289
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,820
胜诉并不等于获得有利裁决
Winning doesn't always mean getting a favorable verdict at trial.

290
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,780
每一件案子中  我们都努力帮助委托人
We try to achieve the best possible outcome

291
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,460
取得可能的最好结果
for our clients, given each individual case.

292
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,880
坦白说  我们费尽心思  才让你们免于逮捕
Frankly, we've worked very hard to stave off an arrest.

293
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,780
你们野营的故事造成了些误会
After the misunderstanding about your, uh, camping trip,

294
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,490
地检官认为你们可能是畏罪潜逃
the D.A. was concerned you might be a flight risk.

295
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,620
畏罪潜逃
A flight risk?

296
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,990
可我们只是待在自家后院
We -- we were practically in our own backyard.

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,900
我们也是这么告诉地检官的
That's exactly what we told the d.A.

298
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,080
不管怎样  我们已经为二位想出一个
In any case, I think we've managed to come up with a deal

299
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,800
此时最有利的协议
that is very favorable under the circumstances.

300
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,590
协议  我可不喜欢这个词
A deal? I hate that terminology.

301
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,640
{\an8}1994年前美式橄榄球运动员
辛普森(O.J. Simpson)杀妻一案

302
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,640
他们给辛普森的就是个"协议"
A deal is what they got O.J.

303
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,660
贝茜  也许我们应该
Well, Betsy, maybe we should, you know,

304
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,390
-先听听看  -这词听着就很可怕
- hear it. - I'm just saying, it's terrible term.

305
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,990
那到底是...什么样的"协议"
What kind of...deal?

306
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,790
如果检方要提起诉讼
If the prosecution decides to file,

307
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,790
目前看来这很有可能
which is definitely the direction this seems to be headed,

308
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,630
并且扣给你一堆罪名的话
and if they choose to stack charges,

309
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,640
克雷格  你就得蹲三十年的大牢了
Craig, you're looking at 30 years in prison.

310
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,100
-三十年  -这是最坏的估计  考虑到
- 30 years? - That's the maximum, and given the nature

311
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,190
这些罪名的性质和目前的政治环境
of the charge and the current political environment,

312
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,850
我们应该做好这个准备
I'd say we should expect it.

313
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,250
公众对此类案件的反感会影响裁决
The public outcry in cases like these is a big factor.

314
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,680
不过  我们和地检官进行了几番交涉
However, after much discussion with the D.A.,

315
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,760
他也希望此事越低调越好
who is also invested in keeping the press to a minimum,

316
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,800
于是我们达成了一致
we have arrived at an arrangement,

317
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,580
你要在郡监狱服刑十六个月
which would include 16 months in a county facility.

318
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,170
十六个月
16 months.

319
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,510
比起三十年已经少很多了
Down from 30 years.

320
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,470
你也很有可能提早出狱
And you most likely wouldn't serve all of it.

321
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,950
但他必须认罪
But he would have to say he was guilty.

322
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,200
认罪和恢复县财政这两个条件
Admitting wrongdoing and making the county whole again

323
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,160
帮了很大的忙  所以才给了最低量刑
goes a long way here -- hence the minimal sentence.

324
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,510
什么叫"恢复县财政"
Uh, "Making the county whole again"?

325
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,170
这包括归还160万
It includes the stipulation that you return $1.6 million

326
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,440
挪用的公款
in misappropriated funds.

327
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,750
-把钱还回去  -但根本没有钱
- Give back the money? - But there is no money.

328
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,380
-没有钱  -早就说了  克雷格是无辜的
- There's no money. - We told you -- Craig is innocent.

329
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,330
我理解
I understand.

330
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,940
但是我还是想强调一下
However, I'd like to emphasize again

331
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,740
这个协议是减少克雷格刑期的最好机会
that this deal is Craig's best chance of minimizing jail time.

332
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,130
你是告诉我们
You're telling us

333
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,650
大街上这么多毒贩子和杀人犯
there are drug dealers and murderers walking the streets,

334
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,990
放着他们不抓
but instead of going after them,

335
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,610
偏要把一个无辜的人关起来
they want to put an innocent man in jail.

336
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,910
没有别的办法...了吗
There's no other...way?

337
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
不好意思  我觉得目前看来
I'm sorry. I think, under the circumstances,

338
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,330
这是你们最好的选择
this is your best option.

339
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,530
杀人犯和强奸犯就是这样...
Murderers and rapists, and this is how they tr--

340
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,720
好吧  我们没有钱  根本就没有钱
Okay. There is no money. There never was.

341
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,150
你必须在庭审上讲明这一点
You have to take this to trial.

342
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,190
听着  这个选择的确很困难
Look, you have a difficult,

343
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,280
但对你们来说也是最直接的办法了
but nevertheless straightforward choice to make here.

344
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,500
一方面  你们把钱交出来
On one hand, you give up the money,

345
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,970
-认...  -我刚说了  没有钱
- plead... - Ah! I just told you -- there is no money.

346
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,230
认罪  我知道这很痛苦
Plead guilty -- it's painful, I know --

347
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,780
坐一年半的牢
And go to jail for a year and a half.

348
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,140
但其他选择...毫无出路
But your other choice -- that is no choice at all.

349
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,690
如果上庭  很有可能败诉
If you go to trial, you'll most likely lose,

350
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,410
克雷格就得坐几十年的牢
and Craig goes to prison for decades.

351
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,060
你们的孩子只能在探视日去监狱
Your children will grow up seeing their dad through bars

352
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,570
见他们的爸爸
on visiting day.

353
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,370
换我肯定不会犹豫
I know what I'd do.

354
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,700
我会接受协议
I'd take the deal.

355
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,120
两年后  你就能从头再来
Two years from now, you can be starting over.

356
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,800
我知道很困难
It's tough, I know...

357
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,450
但你们不会向困难低头
But you're tough people.

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,090
而且你也该为你的家人考虑
And your family is worth it.

359
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,780
我还是让你们俩商量几分钟吧
Why don't I give you a few moments to discuss this?

360
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,360
我知道这个决定很重大
I know it's a big decision.

361
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,220
我们不用商量
We don't need to discuss it.

362
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,780
你被炒了
You're fired.

363
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,410
要不去我的办公室再讨论讨论
How about we go to my office and discuss this?

364
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,430
肯定还有别的办法
I'm sure there's a solution.

365
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,510
没必要
That won't be necessary.

366
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,200
我们不需要你们代理了
We will no longer be requiring your services.

367
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,500
我们真的不是针对你
Yeah, it's not personal, really.

368
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,650
如果你对我们提供的选择不满意
If you're unhappy with what we presented to you,

369
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,170
也许还有别的办法
there may be other directions we can go.

370
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,760
没什么好谈的了  别跟着我们了
We're done here! Please stop following us!

371
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,820
别回头
Don't look back.

372
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,690
只向前看  人生中只向前看
Only look forward. Always in life, look forward.

373
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,370
O70  O70
O-70! O-70!

374
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,370
{\an8}宾果游戏  游戏者根据叫号描出BINGO图案即胜出

375
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,380
太棒了  人到七十精神爽
Oh, yeah. 70's a good age.

376
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,980
好了  埋头看仔细了
All right, duck your heads,

377
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,120
下一个数字要出炉喽
'cause here comes another number.

378
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,610
N32
N-32.

379
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,170
游戏还在继续
And the action never stops.

380
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,310
{\an8}要立遗嘱吗  找麦吉尔

381
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,740
希望大家都带了速效救心丸哦
I hope you all took your heart pills,

382
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,240
这实在是太刺激了  对吧
'cause it's almost too much excitement, right?

383
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,250
到底会是哪个数字呢
Which one will it be?

384
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,920
祈祷吧  来了
Say your prayers. Here it comes.

385
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,860
好了  接下来是G48
All right, we've got G-48 --

386
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,350
就是盖伊·伦巴度[小提琴家]的首字母哦
"G," as in "Guy Lombardo."

387
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,410
G48
G-48.

388
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,840
把自个的手管牢了  别动手动脚的
Keep your elbows to yourselves, okay? No body-checking.

389
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,670
下一个是什么呢
All right, what do we have here?

390
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,050
咱们来看看  B6
Wait for it. B-6.

391
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,870
幸运之B6  就像维他命B6
Lucky B-6, just like the vitamin -- all right --

392
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,540
你们要吃的那种
which you should be taking.

393
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,350
让你们的胃肠道健康运动
Keep things moving in the old G.I. Tract.

394
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,630
宾果
Bingo!

395
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,670
有人赢了
Oh, we have a winner!

396
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,630
幸运女神再次降临
Lady luck has struck again.

397
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,490
举起手来  让大家看看
Let's see a hand so we know who's won.

398
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,030
是后面那位可爱的女士
It's the lovely young lady in the back.

399
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,800
恭喜你  女士  你赢得了...
Congratulations, Miss. You've won a, um --

400
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,610
这位可爱的女士赢得了什么
What do we have for the lovely lady?

401
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,190
笔记本
Notebook.

402
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,190
没错  是一本精致的笔记本
Yeah, it's an adorable notebook.

403
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,250
你喜欢猫咪吗  贵姓...
Do you like cats, Miss, uh...

404
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,510
艾琳  我爱猫咪
Oh, Irene. I love kitties.

405
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,490
我养了两只暹罗猫  奥斯卡和费利克斯
I have two Siamese cats -- Oscar and Felix.

406
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,540
费利克斯会给自己洗澡
Felix can wash himself.

407
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,080
奥斯卡不行  它...就是不行
Oscar won't. He -- he just won't.

408
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,100
多么有趣啊  谢谢你
What a lovely story. Thank you.

409
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,740
你能把这个给艾琳吗
Um, can you take that to Irene?

410
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,000
你回来了帮我顶一下  行吗
And when you come back, cover -- yeah?

411
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,730
我要休息一小会
Uh, I'm gonna take a short break,

412
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:11,440
有人需要我提供法律援助
'cause somebody needs legal help.

413
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,050
詹姆斯·麦吉尔先生办公室
Offices of James McGill,

414
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,370
请问您要找谁
Esquire. How may I direct your call?

415
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,310
好的  好的  没问题  请稍等
Yes. Yes, of course. Um, one moment, please.

416
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,860
又见面了
Déjàvu. Hello, again.

417
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,900
-很高兴见到你们  -你好
- Good to see you. - Nice to see you.

418
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,170
有什么需要我帮忙的吗
So, how may I be of service?

419
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,000
我们想雇你当我们的律师  麦吉尔先生
Well, we would like to hire you as our attorney, Mr. McGill.

420
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,240
真的吗
Wow. Really?

421
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,110
但是我们有一些条件
However, we have certain conditions,

422
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,680
你必须接受
and these are not up for debate.

423
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,690
我们不想坐牢  完全不想
We want no jail time -- zero.

424
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,850
克雷格是清白的  我们希望你能证明
Craig is innocent, and we expect you to prove that.

425
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,710
我们不想再让他的名声遭到如此诽谤
We won't see his name smeared like this any longer.

426
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,960
能先别着急吗
Um, can we back up just a scooch?

427
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,670
上次你们还非常肯定
'Cause last time we spoke, you were very enthusiastic --

428
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,030
坚持要委托哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
you were positively insistent about being represented by HHM.

429
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,780
没事  不用加
Well, uh... That's all right.

430
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,650
我们意见不合
We've parted ways.

431
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,580
为什么呢
May I ask why?

432
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,490
我们不同意他们的辩护策略
We...disagreed with their defense strategy.

433
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,420
好吧
Okay.

434
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,750
他们当我们是罪犯
They treated us like we were guilty.

435
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,590
之前拒绝我为你们代理  而现在...
So, your previous objections to my representing you are now...

436
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,220
抱歉  上次是我没想清楚
Oh, I'm sorry about my bluntness at our last encounter.

437
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,610
很不幸
Unfortunate.

438
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,880
没错  但我们
Yeah, I -- but we really --

439
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,960
我们对此非常抱歉
we're very sorry about that.

440
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,430
我们深思熟虑过后
We thought long and hard about it,

441
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,380
我们...
and, um, we...

442
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,670
考虑到你的热情
And, you know, given your passion

443
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,130
和你敢于挑战的态度
and your can-do attitude... mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

444
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,820
我们真心
...we really --

445
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,680
-相信你就是我们的律师  -没错
- We just believe that you're the lawyer for us. - For us, yes.

446
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,500
这么说真是抬举我
Well, as flattered as I am by this,

447
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,050
但自从上次以后
um, since we last spoke,

448
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,420
我转变了主攻领域
I've changed my area of specialization,

449
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,170
现在专注于老年法
so I concentrate on Elder law now.

450
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,680
但你说过会全力帮我们
But, I mean, you said that you would fight for us.

451
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,340
没错  你当时...相当坚定
Yeah, you... you were -- you were adamant.

452
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,470
你答应过帮我们拿到无罪判决
You promised to get us a not-guilty verdict.

453
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,870
我不是这么答应的
I don't think I exactly promised that.

454
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,740
你说我们会是头号委托人
You said we would be client number one,

455
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,800
全天候待命
morning, noon, or night, and --

456
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,960
没错  我当时是认真的
Yes, and I meant what I said, at the time,

457
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,480
但是今非昔比
But times change.

458
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,420
但我们已经付了预付金
But we've already paid you a retainer.

459
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,250
没错  预付金
Right. A retainer.

460
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,860
你们就这么叫吧
That is what you called it.

461
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,150
这是你们律师的术语
That was your specific terminology.

462
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,840
抱歉我失陪一下
It -- could you excuse me for a moment?

463
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,250
我憋了很久了
I, uh, had a big gulp on the way over.

464
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,810
你好
Hey, there.

465
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,920
有意思
Funny story.

466
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,730
我再次找到了属于你的东西
I found something that belongs to you -- again.

467
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,420
-是吗  是什么  -是"谁"
- Yeah? What? - "Who?"

468
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,830
想象一下弗兰德夫妇主演《第25小时》
Picture "The 25th Hour,” starring Ned and Maude Flanders.

469
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,830
{\an8}《辛普森一家》的角色

470
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,420
天  凯特尔曼夫妇吗
Oh, christ. The Kettlemans?

471
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,320
今天还流失了其他客户吗
You lose any other clients today?

472
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,170
没错
Yeah.

473
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,510
疯子先生和太太
Mr. And Mrs. Cuckoo Bananas

474
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,440
把辩护的肥差给了我
just offered me the plum job of defending them.

475
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,730
他们去找你了
They came to you?

476
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,820
可不是嘛
Yeah, I know.

477
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,230
我不清楚你怎么惹毛了他们
I don't know what you did to piss them off,

478
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,620
但肯定不得了
but it must have been good.

479
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,080
他们说了什么
W-What did they tell you?

480
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,490
没说什么  只说了你
Not much, just, uh, that you treated them

481
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,080
-把他们当罪犯  -天哪
- like they were guilty. - Jesus.

482
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,420
吉米  我知道...
Look, Jimmy...I know...

483
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,640
这样要求很过分
I know this is a lot to ask,

484
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,150
但你得说服他们回我们律所
but you have to convince them to come back to HHM.

485
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,210
-是吗  -没错
- I Do, Huh? - Yes.

486
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,320
求你了  这很重要
Please. It's important.

487
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,030
-你觉得值吗  -吉米  我没说笑
- What's it worth to you? - Jimmy, I'm serious.

488
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,650
他们离开是因为他们觉得能打赢官司
They left because they think they can win this case,

489
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,160
但他们赢不了
but they can't.

490
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,810
根本没什么有利因素
I managed to scrape together --

491
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,860
我东拼西凑才提出一个协议
from practically nothing, I might add --

492
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,400
他们应该感到幸运才是
a deal they should feel lucky to have.

493
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,610
这才是最有希望的办法
This is their absolute best bet.

494
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,340
求你了...
Please...

495
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,740
告诉他们  回来是更好的选择
make them understand it's better for them if they come back.

496
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,670
跟我说说这协议
Tell me about this deal.

497
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,140
老年法
Elder law?

498
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,700
我不知道他什么意思
I don't know what that is.

499
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,280
我也不知道
Yeah, me neither.

500
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,900
老年  你觉得...
Elder. Do you think...

501
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,210
也许如果我们老了...
Maybe if we were old --

502
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,000
久等
Sorry. Whoo! Oh.

503
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,840
膀胱到底能装多少呢
The mysteries of the bladder. Right?

504
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,700
所以怎么说
So, how do we get started?

505
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,210
要签那份合同吗
Do you need us to sign that little paper?

506
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,430
我感到非常抱歉
I am -- I am very sorry,

507
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,600
但我恐怕接不了你们的案子
but I'm afraid I can't take your case.

508
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,300
我的日程排得满满当当
My schedule is just -- it's just chock-full right now.

509
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,480
强烈建议你们回哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
I highly encourage you to go back to HHM.

510
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,460
我确定他们会非常欢迎你们
I'm certain they would welcome you with open arms.

511
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,470
不  我们不回去
No, we're not going back there.

512
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,760
跟他们...合不来
They were... incompatible.

513
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,690
我懂
I understand.

514
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,720
他们让你们面对残酷的现实
They asked you to face some harsh realities,

515
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,970
我理解  没人喜欢
and I get it -- no one likes that.

516
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,240
但最重要的是金·韦克斯勒是个好律师
But bottom line here -- Kim Wexler is a fine attorney.

517
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,600
她和地方检察官关系很好
She has a great relationship with the D.A.

518
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,110
虽然我很想自吹自擂
Much as I'd love to sing my own praises,

519
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,850
但我很可能搞不定
I doubt I could get you a deal

520
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,790
比她更好的协议
as good as the one she already has.

521
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,910
我们不想要"协议"
Okay, we don't want a deal.

522
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,720
我们希望你  我们的律师  还他清白
We want you, our lawyer, to exonerate Craig.

523
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,570
"还他清白"
"Exonerate"?

524
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,370
有点言过其实了
That is, uh -- that is a big word,

525
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,470
特别是你们这个官司
particularly in your case.

526
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,220
我们不会接受什么协议
Yeah, there will be no deal.

527
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,940
我们根本没贪  谈什么协议
There is no money with which to make a deal.

528
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:14,010
我们不要再自欺欺人了好吗
We -- can we all three just parachute down from cloud cuckoo land?

529
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,480
因为我们心知肚明  钱是有的
'Cause we know, without question, there is money.

530
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,790
-不  没有  -我清楚地记得为了这袋钱
- No, there... - I distinctly remember a spirited game

531
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,750
我们曾激烈地拔河呢
of tug-of-war over this money,

532
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,050
这笔钱我们讨论了好久
Money which we then discussed at length.

533
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,680
你找了很多借口
You made many excuses

534
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,720
来为这笔钱辩护
justifying your possession of said money.

535
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,180
钱是有的
It's there. It exists.

536
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,710
拜托  我快要疯了...
S-shh. Now, just, please, for my own sanity...

537
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,680
你们不可能把一大袋钱藏一辈子
You can't hide a big bag of cash forever,

538
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,550
也肯定花不了其中的一分钱
and you certainly will never be able to spend any of it.

539
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,590
所以还是回律所  向韦克斯勒小姐道歉
So, go back to HHM, apologize to Ms. Wexler,

540
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,170
然后接受那个协议
and for Christ's sakes, take the deal.

541
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,200
如果真有钱的话
If there were any money --

542
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,090
女士  够了
Lady, enough!

543
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,490
如果真有钱的话
If there were any money,

544
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,820
那就要进行全面结算
there would have to be a full accounting of it.

545
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,420
每一分钱都要拿出来
Every penny would have to be present --

546
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,000
每一分钱
Every single penny.

547
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,470
你懂了吧
You understand?

548
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,980
全部
All of it.

549
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,980
包括给你那三万...
That includes the $30,000 that you --

550
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,530
-克雷格  他懂了  -好吧  他懂了
- Craig, yes, he gets it. - Okay. Yeah, he gets it.

551
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,920
不管发生什么  麦吉尔先生
We're in this together, Mr. McGill...

552
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,460
我们是一条船上的
Come what may.

553
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,790
现在我们怎么办
Now where do we begin?

554
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,940
你要的凯特尔曼的卷宗  全在这儿了
There you go. Kettleman -- that's all of it.

555
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,220
金呢
Where's Kim?

556
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,250
她搬到东翼去了
We moved her over to the east wing.

557
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,970
东翼  玉米地那边
The east wing? That's the cornfield.

558
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,390
为什么把她搬到玉米地那边  霍华德
Why are you sending her to the cornfield, Howard?

559
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,020
以前从没这么叫过
Never heard it called that before.

560
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,890
你就是这么叫的
Well, that's what you call it.

561
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,590
你要惩罚她
You gonna punish her

562
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,700
就因为你失去了那对精神错乱的客户
just 'cause you lost those two batshit Kettlemans?

563
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,520
你看我一点都没有因为
You notice I'm not exactly crowing over

564
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,800
挖走了你的客户而洋洋得意
how I snaked them away from you.

565
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,740
吉米  这是你要的卷宗
Jimmy, here are your files.

566
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,600
我懒得跟你讨论我的员工政策
I'm not gonna discuss my employee policies with you.

567
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,810
我还需要人来帮忙
I'm gonna need some help here.

568
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,340
是啊...
Yeah...

569
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,720
的确如此
You sure are.

570
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,560
那个混蛋要开除你吗
That prick firing you?

571
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,140
最佳情况也是  我的两年计划
Best-case scenario is my 2-year plan

572
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,030
现在变成十年计划了
iust became a 10-year plan.

573
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,080
那个蠢货  你没做错什么
That schmuck. You didn't do anything wrong.

574
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,850
-我丢客户了  -不是你的错
- I lost the client. - Not your fault.

575
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,340
他们已经神志不清了
They're not really playing with a full deck --

576
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,740
凯特尔曼两口子
Those Kettlemans.

577
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,190
你要接他们的案子
You had to take their case?

578
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,430
对不起  我试过了  我真尽力了
I'm sorry, okay? I tried. I r-- I really did.

579
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,480
我有点强人所难了  你当然尽力了
I'm not being fair. Of course you tried.

580
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,090
他们想怎么做是他们的事
They'll do what they want to do.

581
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,120
希望你没有对他们夸下海口
Hope you didn't promise them too much.

582
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,680
我不相信你能做得
I doubt you'll be able to do more for them

583
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,180
比我们律所还好
than we were offering.

584
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,920
你对我的实力评价很高嘛
You think very highly of my skills, obviously.

585
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,980
不是这个意思  吉米  这个官司输定了
It's not that, Jimmy. It's a loser case.

586
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,190
那个协议是他们最好的机会了
That deal was their best chance.

587
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,630
我累死累活跟地检官兜圈子
After I worked my ass off finagling with the D.A.,

588
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,020
结果呢...  算了
and it's just like... whatever.

589
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,570
肯定还是有办法的  对吧
There's got to be a way, you know?

590
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,780
-待我上了庭...  -你输定了
- I take it to court... - You'll lose.

591
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,890
凯特尔曼连如何销毁证据都不会
Kettleman did a terrible job covering his tracks.

592
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:53,460
首先
For starters,

593
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,910
他开了大量虚假开支的支票
they've got reams of checks he wrote for false expenses.

594
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,840
我只能眼巴巴看着它们被归为证据
And I can't even challenge their admission into evidence

595
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,170
因为那是他开给自己的
because he wrote them to himself.

596
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,650
我知道我们绝不能承认委托人是有罪的
I know we're never supposed to say our clients are guilty,

597
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,460
但是  反正也不是我的委托人了
but, hey, not my client anymore --

598
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,930
他罪不可赦
He's guilty as sin.

599
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,590
好吧  但是应该有办法...
Yeah, but there has to be something --

600
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,370
-有什么漏洞或者  -反正我找不出了
- Some loophole or... - None that I could find.

601
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,670
一定有什么办法的
There has to be a way.

602
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,990
吐钱就有办法
Not without the money.

603
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,310
这是凯特尔曼夫妇唯一的筹码了
It's the only chip those Kettlemans have,

604
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,870
而他们却不接受
and they refuse to play it.

605
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,440
{\an8}挪用公款

606
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,750
在今晚的第二局中
And Anderson leads things off

607
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,290
安德森做首击球员
in the top of the second inning here tonight.

608
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,050
第一投  曲线球未击中
First pitch -- curve ball for a strike.

609
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,620
比分0比1
Count is 0-1.

610
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,440
本来有些担心
There was some concern

611
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,210
今晚会有小雨
that we'd have some light showers,

612
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,890
不过看起来是杞人忧天了
but it looks like it's gonna be clear tonight.

613
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,100
-是的  -一个坏球  1比1
- Absolutely. - That's a ball. 1-1.

614
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,090
天
No.

615
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,110
奥特纳尔准备好了
Ortner readies.

616
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,470
投球  是一记直奔右中场空区的直线球
Throws, and it is a liner toward the gap in right-center field.

617
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,490
罗伯茨开始跑了  接球...
Roberts on the run, reaches out...

618
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,940
接到球了
And makes the grab.

619
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,200
这样第二局就领先一分了
And that puts one away here in the second inning.

620
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,760
下一个上场的是总是令人印象深刻的李
Next up, the always imposing Lee.

621
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,060
这个赛季他有个不错的开始
And he's had a great start this season.

622
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,850
天呐  每次看都觉得更多了
Jesus. Gets bigger every time I look at it.

623
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,800
感谢您没有卷款潜逃
Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.

624
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,490
你在做什么呢
What are you doing?

625
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,190
"正确的事情"
"The right thing."

626
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,260
你知道要去哪里吗
You know where you're going?

627
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,020
是的
Yeah.

628
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,210
所以我们两清了吗
Am I correct in assuming we're now square?

629
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,290
两清了
Square.

630
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,070
早上好
Good morning.

631
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,850
是谁来了  克雷格
Who is it, Craig?

632
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,140
是麦吉尔先生
Oh,it's Mr. McGil!

633
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,650
早上好  快请进吧
Good morning. Come on in.

634
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,330
我很喜欢你们的布置
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.

635
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,520
我上次来的时候  这里还不能去竞争
Last time I was here, it was, uh, well, not a contender

636
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,930
《好管家》杂志的封面呢
for the cover of Good Housekeeping --

637
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,160
那是肯定的
that's for sure.

638
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,050
你有关于我们案件的进展了吗
Do you have news about our case?

639
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,890
实际上  我有
I do, in fact.

640
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,210
但是在我们直击核心之前
But before we get to the nitty-gritty,

641
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,690
我们应该先谈谈你们的协议
I think we should chat about your deal.

642
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,120
我们告诉过你了  不接受协议
We told you -- there will be no deal.

643
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,310
你确实说过了
You did, didn't you?

644
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,640
但是  现在情况有变
However, circumstances have changed.

645
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,400
什么情况
What circumstances?

646
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,140
为了回答这个问题
To answer that, um,

647
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,710
我能建议你们先去检查下那些钱吗
might I suggest that you go check on that money

648
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,520
就是你坚持说没有贪的那些
you insist you didn't take?

649
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,940
在楼上浴室的水池下面
In the upstairs bathroom, under the sink?

650
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,850
等等  你是怎么
Wait. How could you...

651
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,560
贝茜
Betsy!

652
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,180
不  不  不
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!

653
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,670
没事的  贝茜  肯定是...
It's okay. It's okay, betsy. It's got to be...

654
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,140
不  它们肯定在这里的
No. It's got to be in there somewhere.

655
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,410
你把它怎么了
What did you do with it?

656
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,380
"它"指的是...
By "It," You mean...

657
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,250
钱在哪里
Where is it?!

658
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,280
你是指钱啊  让我想想
You mean the money. Uh, let me see.

659
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,910
它已经在路上了
Uh, it's, uh, on its way

660
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,920
快到地检官的桌子上了吧
to the D.A.'s desk right about now.

661
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,780
什么  你  你个小偷
What? You -- oh, you thief!

662
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,790
彼此彼此
Takes one to know one, doesn't it?

663
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,160
是他拿的吗  你是怎么偷走的
He took it? How did you take it?

664
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,530
一个好的魔术师从来不会揭晓自己的秘密
A good magician never reveals his secrets.

665
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,900
好了  接下来我们要这么做
Now, here's what we're gonna do.

666
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,630
不需要你来告诉我们怎么做
Oh, you don't tell us what to do.

667
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,930
你偷了我们的钱
You stole from us.

668
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,580
我们会让警察逮捕你的
We'll -- we will have you arrested.

669
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:43,010
看得出你很生气
I-I can see how upset you are, and,

670
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,150
但即使是在你清醒的时候
even on a good day,

671
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,220
你也毫无逻辑...
you and logic are...

672
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,370
你刚说要逮捕我
But think about what you just said.

673
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,790
罪犯可没法让警察逮捕别人
Criminals have no recourse.

674
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,440
而你们两个就是彻头彻尾的罪犯
And you two -- you're criminals, big-time.

675
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,470
你竟敢
How dare you?

676
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:57,540
幸运的是  你们那聪明绝顶的律师
Luckily, you have a very talented lawyer

677
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,290
已经找到了方法
who has found a way to minimize the damage

678
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,110
将伤害降到最低
you've brought upon yourselves.

679
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,420
你已经被炒了
Oh, you're fired.

680
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,050
我已经辞职了  我说的是金·韦克斯勒
Oh, I quit already. No, I'm talking about Kim Wexler.

681
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,730
现在你们要回去找她
Now, you're gonna go back to her,

682
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,090
为之前草率地终止她的代理
you're gonna apologize for your hasty decision

683
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:10,930
向她道歉
to terminate her services,

684
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,750
你们要接受她的好意  接受那份协议
And you're gonna fall on her mercy and take that deal.

685
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,870
我们会说出你收我们贿赂的事情
We'll tell... about the bribe you took.

686
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,440
你可以那么做  当然可以
You could do that. You absolutely could.

687
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,100
那样我就会陷入麻烦
And I'd be in a mess of trouble --

688
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,490
大麻烦
A real pickle...

689
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,430
但是你也一样  凯特尔曼夫人
But so would you, Mrs. Kettleman.

690
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,040
因为现在只有凯特尔曼先生
Cause right now, only Mr. Kettleman is on the hook

691
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,600
被资产挪用这件烂事套牢了
for the whole embezzlement kerfuffle.

692
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,630
但是贿赂  怎么又把它叫做贿赂了
But the bribe -- w-we're back to calling it a bribe? --

693
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,910
这个也会影响到你的
Yeah, that implicates you, as well.

694
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,140
不会的
It does not.

695
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,320
-全都是我做的  -并不是
- It was all me. - No, it wasn't.

696
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,420
我保证会告诉大家的
I'll make sure everyone knows that.

697
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,200
往好的方面想想
Look on the bright side, you know?

698
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,470
也许他们会想出
They could work out some kind of

699
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,650
监狱间夫妻互相探视的项目
inter-prison visitation program, the occasional conjugal.

700
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,330
也许也不算太糟糕
Maybe it won't be all bad.

701
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,410
你也许还能组织自己的帮派呢
You -- you'll probably wind up running your own gang.

702
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,660
你们要知道
Thing you folks need to know about me --

703
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,560
我已经一无所有了
I got nothing to lose.

704
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,510
天啊  可惜了我那漂亮的办公室
Christ, you should see my office.

705
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,950
-不  还没有结束  -结束了
- No, it's not over. - Yeah.

706
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,830
我们再去找个律师
Let's find another lawyer.

707
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,960
-好了  贝茜  -不  不
- Come on, betsy. - No, no.

708
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,620
不  我们不能容忍这样
No. We don't have to put up with this.

709
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,800
我绝不能受到这样的对待
I will not be treated this way.

710
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,150
贝茜  还有孩子们
Betsy...the kids.

711
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,310
孩子们
The...

712
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,510
我们必须要这么做
We have to do this...

713
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,370
为了我们的孩子
For the kids.

714
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,910
他们不能同时失去我们两个
They can't lose us both.

715
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,440
我们必须要这样做
We have to.

716
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,570
不
No.

717
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,550
不
No.

718
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,670
会没事的
It's okay.

719
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,720
都会好的
It's okay.

720
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:55,710
多谢了
Thank you.
