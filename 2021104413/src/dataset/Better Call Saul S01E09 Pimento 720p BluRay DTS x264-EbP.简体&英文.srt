像这样把鞋脱了
Kick off your shoes. Like this.

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,900
你上回这么做是什么时候
When was the last time you did that?

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,090
感觉还不错吧
Feels good, right?

如果我是斯韦卡特和考科利公司
If I were Schweikart and Cokely,

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,140
我会想办法弄一张限制令
I'd seek a restraining order,

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:32,810
把这事变成民事骚扰问题
turn this into a civil-harassment issue.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,660
斯韦卡特和考科利可以尽情地
Schweikart and Cokely can come after me

38
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,190
用限制令或别的东西来对付我

I'll be ready.

有信心很好
Confidence is good.

41

有事实依据在手会更好
Facts on your side, better.

42
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,210
要明白自己将要面对什么
Know what you're walking into.

43
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,210
房子需要刷漆了
House needs a coat of paint.

我向你保证  如果那小畜生有跳蚤

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,530
我会亲自教训它一顿
I'll-I'll kick her butt myself.

贼进门偷东西之前还要三思呢

是啊  这小家伙肯定能吓走不少坏人

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,120
随便说说而已
It's just a thought.

54
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,150
你可以把它养在我那里

74
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,110
-迫害吗  -是的  你不让我见我的委托人
- Victims? - My clients. Yes. You're denying me access.

76
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,030
也有权见律师

难道我可怜的老年委托人
Are you saying my poor, elderly clients

78
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,250
拥有的权利还不如罪犯多吗
have fewer rights than a bunch of jail inmates?

79
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,110
不是这个意思
Not at all,

80
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,720
没有人阻止麦吉尔先生见他的委托人
and no one is denying Mr. McGill access to his clients.

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,370
我们是阻止他进入养老院
We're denying him access to the property...

82
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,610
-这是歪曲事实  -养老院由矶鹞渡管理
- It's semantics. - Which is well within Sandpiper Crossing's rights.

83
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,360
那是私人财产
The building is private property.

84
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,760
钱可是那些老人在付
Paid for by the residents.

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,680
但管理者是有执照的专业看护人员
But managed by licensed health-aid professionals.

86

先生们  一次一个人
Okay, one at a time, gentlemen.

87
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,530
斯韦卡特先生  你为什么不让他进入养老院
Mr. Schweikart, you're denying him access on what grounds?

88
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,720
这些需要生活协助的老年人
These assisted-living residents

89
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,960
已经养成了固定的生活习惯
have a daily routine that they're used to,

90
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,630
而麦吉尔先生总是吵吵闹闹
and Mr. McGill, who is very loud and flamboyant,

91
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,640
这种行为严重影响了他们的生活
is a disturbance to these routines.

92
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,890
想要见律师的老年人
Residents who want to see a lawyer--

93
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,330
什么时候想离开都行
free to leave whenever they want.

94
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,500
什么叫随时离开
Leave whenever they want?

95
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,190
那些可是行动不便的老人
We're talking about elderly and infirm people here.

96
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,840
换句通俗的话说就是
The most common phrase in this place?

97
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,480
"我摔倒了  我起不来了"
"I've fallen, and I can't get up."

98
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,110
你可以提供电话咨询
There's phone consultations.

99
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,760
还有邮件和信使服务
There's mail and messenger services.

100
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,040
还有好多其他方法和委托人商谈
There's plenty of other ways to confer with clients,

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,080
但对于那些
But for residents who

102
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,980
不想被麦吉尔先生骚扰的人来说
don't want to be afflicted with Mr. McGill's presence,

103
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,800
这就属于民事骚扰案件了
This becomes an issue of civil harassment.

104
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,770
你还真敢把"民事骚扰"用在这里
Wow! You are stretching that definition to its limit.

105
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,280
你要知道  老年人爱死我了
And F.Y.I., old people adore me.

106
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,560
肃静  我已经了解了
Okay, I've heard enough.

107
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,020
我已经可以对这份限制令作出裁决了
I have enough here to let me rule on this restraining order.

108
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,650
太棒了
Yeah!

109
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,130
别担心  查克  你闻到的不是烟
Don't worry, Chuck. That's not smoke you smell.

110
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,160
是我
That's me.

111
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,810
我牛逼得快要烧起来了
This mofo is on fire.

112
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,220
你的老弟今天狠狠教训了斯韦卡特
Your baby bro kicked some Schweikart ass today.

113
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,780
这些都是什么
What the hell's all this?

114
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,540
你还在法庭时送来的快递
There was a delivery while you were in court.

115
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,900
是斯韦卡特和考科利公司送过来的吗
What, Schweikart and Cokely sent this?

116
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,530
是什么
What -- what is it?

117
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,030
他们对每一位集体诉讼代表都提出了质询
They served interrogatories on each class representative.

118
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,870
这一箱是作证通知
Uh, this box is deposition notices,

119
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,580
他们质疑我们许多老年委托人
documents calling into question the

120
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,840
精神方面可能有问题
mental health of many of our elderly clients,

121
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,500
通过证明他们并没有上诉能力
attempting to stop the class from being certified

122
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,820
试图阻止这次集体诉讼
on the grounds they're not competent to file.

123
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,160
这只是个开始
Oh, this is just the beginning.

124
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,680
他们还会持续地给我们送文件
They're gonna continue this document dump

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,010
直到把我们淹没为止
until we're drowning in paperwork.

126
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,470
好吧  我们可以处理好
All right. We can deal with this.

127
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,470
我是说  这个
I mean, hey, it's, uh...

128
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,620
都只是文书工作嘛
it's just paperwork, right?

129
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,930
没什么大不了的  硬着头皮上就行了
It's no big deal. Just hit it head on.

130
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,640
-吉米  -按优先顺序处理
- Jimmy. - Prioritize.

131
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,420
最重要的事情放在前面
Uh, most important stuff first.

132
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,120
还是先处理简单的比较好
Or is it better to, uh, deal with the easy stuff?

133
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,880
先把那些处理了
You know, get that off the decks.

134
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,670
查克  你来选
And, uh, you tell me, Chuck.

135
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,290
你就随便指一个箱子
I mean, you just point to a box.

136
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,760
我们能够做到
We can do this.

137
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,580
吉米  我们需要谈谈
Jimmy, we need to talk.

138
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,530
-查克  -先坐下吧
- Chuck. - Sit down, won't you?

139
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,750
没事  我还是站着吧
No, I'm good.

140
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,010
我知道你不喜欢听我接下来要说的话
I know you're not gonna like what I have to say next,

141
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,750
但是事实就是事实
but facts are facts.

142
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,620
我们现在所面对的  这个案件的规模
And what we're facing here, a case this size,

143
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,060
已经不是两个人能搞定的了
it is not a two-man job.

144
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,310
-我们需要帮助  -不
- We need help. - No.

145
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,940
为了委托人的利益
And for the good of the clients,

146
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,060
我们需要将这个案件委托
we need to refer this case --

147
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,530
别说出来
Don't say it. Don't say --

148
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,580
把它委托给哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
Refer it out to HHM.

149
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,310
该死  查克
Damn it, chuck.

150
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,460
不  拜托
No! Come on!

151
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,540
我们可以做到的  我们自己能做得很好
We can do this. We're doing great on our own.

152
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,510
我们不需要哈姆林或者其他人
We don't need Hamlin or anyone else.

153
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,100
等等
I mean, wait, hey,

154
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,730
我们可以像艾琳·布洛科维奇一样解决它
We can Erin Brokovich the shit out of this case.

155
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,730
{\an8}美国律师助理  环保活动家

156
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,820
艾琳·布洛科维奇也不是自己做到的
Erin Brokovich didn't do it alone.

157
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,280
她和埃德·马斯瑞从洛杉矶找来重量级帮手
She and Ed Masry brought in heavy hitters from Los Angeles

158
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,260
才最终赢得了那个案件
to get that case across the goal line,

159
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,990
而我们现在正需要如此
and that's what we need to do.

160
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,080
而且那没什么丢脸的
And there's no shame in that.

161
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,780
这是我们的案子
This is our case!

162
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,330
没错  但任务异常艰巨
Yes, it's ours, and the task ahead is monumental.

163
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,110
我们能单独完成吗
Could we do it alone?

164
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,030
两人可以建起布鲁克林大桥吗
Could two men alone build the Brooklyn Bridge?

165
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,160
也许可以  但是得花一辈子的时间
Maybe. But it would take forever!

166
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,750
你觉得
Just how long do you think

167
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,240
矶鹞渡的住户还可以活多久
the residents of Sandpiper Crossing have?

168
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,890
把这个案子委托给哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
Referring this case to HHM

169
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,830
才真正对委托人有利
is for the good of the clients.

170
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,060
你以为今天你赢了  法官没有批准限制令
That argument you won today, against the restraining order?

171
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,020
但法官本来就不会批准的
Judge was never gonna grant that.

172
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,880
斯韦卡特在耍花招
Schweikart is throwing softballs,

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,360
他会不停地一个花招接着一个花招
and he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.

174
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,930
我们就会一直疲于应付
And we'll be so busy swatting them away,

175
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,320
真正花在案子上的时间反而所剩无几
we'll never spend any time on the actual case.

176
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,680
这案子肯定会持续数年
This case will span years,

177
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,620
我俩是没有实力推动案件进展的
and we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.

178
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,020
根本不可能
We simply don't.

179
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,340
好吧
Fine.

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,300
所以
So?

181
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,530
把案子拿给哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
The case goes to HHM?

182
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,360
撒旦万岁
Hail Satan.

183
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,190
我向黑暗投降
I submit to the dark side.

184
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,300
我去给金打电话安排会面
I'll call Kim and arrange a meeting.

185
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,490
太好了  吉米  谢谢你
All right. Good, Jimmy. Thank you.

186
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,170
我知道你一定会明白这是最好的处理方式
I know you'll come to see that it's for the best.

187
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,630
那我得在你隔壁找间办公室了
I guess I'll have to get an office right next to yours.

188
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,190
总算脱离了收发室  不是吗
Finally out of the mailroom, huh?

189
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,340
你好
Yes. Hello.

190
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,080
不  是我
No, it's me.

191
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,350
我们是在这儿等吗
This the place where we wait?

192
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,450
应该是
Think so.

193
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,080
那么
So...

194
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,070
那人跟你俩说了这活儿是干嘛的吗
...what did our guy tell you about the job?

195
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,160
没说太多
Not much.

196
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,810
是个保镖的活儿  一个平民
It's a protection job. Civilian.

197
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,350
他相当没有经验
Guy is as green as they come,

198
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,690
但是我们会保证事情顺利进行
but we'll be in there to make sure things fly right.

199
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,560
你俩做这行很久了吧
You been doing this long?

200
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,670
我认为我们都是重量级人物
I-I just assume we're all heavy hitters,

201
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,490
这很合理  毕竟兽医只挑最好的
and it makes sense -- the vet recommends best of the best.

202
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,400
跟这些人种的人打交道
Dealing with some of these ethnic types,

203
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,240
总是会让人热血沸腾
blood tends to run a little hotter.

204
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,400
这是科学  生理学
That's just science. Physiology.

205
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,850
这是有历史先例的  你懂我的意思吧
There's historical precedent. You know what I'm saying?

206
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,430
你带了啥
So, what you packing?

207
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,890
甜椒
Uh, pimento.

208
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,220
啥玩意儿
Sorry, what?

209
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,290
甜椒三明治
Pimento sandwich.

210
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,560
真好笑
That's funny.

211
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,900
甜椒
Pimento.

212
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,900
我是问  你身上带了什么没有
No, I mean, what are you carrying?

213
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,420
你懂的  枪
You know, piece?

214
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,110
-什么枪  -甜椒是一种奶酪
- What's the make? - Pimento is a cheese.

215
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,200
它被称为南方的鱼子酱
They call it the caviar of the south.

216
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,980
你不想说就算了
Look, you don't want to tell me what you're carrying,

217
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,590
但是别把我当傻逼玩
so be it, but you don't have to be a douche about it.

218
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,460
我告诉你我带的东西是什么了
Just told you what I'm carrying.

219
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,060
所以你的意思是  你没带枪
So you're saying... you don't have a gun?

220
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,610
你是这个意思吗
Is that what you're saying?

221
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,060
你居然不带枪就来这儿了  你带了么
How are you here without a gun? You have a gun?

222
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,760
-带了  -当然得带
- Yeah. - Yeah. Of course.

223
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,870
他带着枪呢
He's got a gun.

224
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,500
我带了至少两把枪呢
I got at least two guns on me that I'll tell you about.

225
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,250
我有把老式威尔逊格斗1911
I go old school with a Wilson Combat 1911,

226
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,360
还有把格洛克22第三代
I got a Glock 22 gen 3,

227
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,450
我就只告诉你这两把
and those are just the ones I'll tell you about.

228
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,100
该死
I mean, what the hell?

229
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,800
你怎么连把枪都不带
Really, how do you not pack a gun?

230
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,590
你们好  我是普赖斯
Hi. Hello. Uh, my name is Pryce.

231
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,010
实际上  这不是我的名字
Um, actually, that's not my name.

232
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,250
不过我有个侄子叫普赖斯
But, uh, I have a nephew named Pryce.

233
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,850
我一直都挺喜欢那个名字的
I've always kind of liked that name.

234
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
不过  我们今天不是来讨论名字的
Anyway, we're not dealing with names today.

235
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,560
你们告不告诉我名字都行  说个假的也行
You can tell me or not tell me yours, or a fake one is fine.

236
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,450
如果我要跟你们说话
If I need to talk to you,

237
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,730
我希望最好不要以"哎  你"开头
I'd prefer something other than, "Hey, you."

238
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,390
总之  你们都是被强烈推荐来的  谢谢
Either way, you all come highly recommended, so thank you.

239
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,510
第一  我们要开很久的车
First order of business, we have a long drive ahead of us.

240
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,720
我车里有饮水机  还有一些饮料
I have a cooler of water in the car, some soft drinks.

241
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,690
我不喝咖啡  你们要喝的话转角有家餐厅
I don't drink coffee, but there is a diner on the corner.

242
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,770
那还有个厕所  出发之前想上厕所就去
Also a bathroom in there in case you need to go before, we go.

243
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,880
第二  是关于钱
Second order, uh, money.

244
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,980
确认一下说好的雇佣费是
Just to be clear that the agreed-upon fee

245
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,620
每个人五百美元  都没意见吧
of $500 per man is...agreed upon.

246
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,440
-如果大家都能接受的话  -我有意见
- Uh, if that's acceptable... - yeah, I have a thought.

247
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,780
请讲
Y-yeah?

248
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,730
不如给我和大个子每人七百五
How about you give me and man mountain $750 each

249
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,530
让糟老头走人
and send Uncle Fester there home?

250
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,060
他连枪都没带
He's not carrying a gun.

251
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,450
他就是个废物
He's useless.

252
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,610
他说的是真的吗  你没带枪
I-is that true? Y-you di-- you didn't bring a gun?

253
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,470
我不需要带枪
I didn't think I'd need one.

254
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,650
这可是个保镖活儿
It's a protection job.

255
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,230
你需要枪来保护你的雇主
It's basic common sense that you need a gun

256
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,330
这是基本常识
to protect your employer.

257
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,690
懂吗
I mean, duh!

258
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:29,970
你是我们的负担
You're dead weight.

259
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,770
他就是个没带枪的废物
He's just a third wheel without a piece.

260
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,350
听我说  我要用枪的话可以从他那儿拿一把
I'll tell you what, if I need a gun, I'll use one of his.

261
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,380
是吗  想用我的枪
Really? One of my guns?

262
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,700
怎么可能呢
How do you picture that happening, exactly?

263
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,890
我会直接动手拿
Well, I guess I'm gonna take it from you.

264
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,980
想法不错嘛
That...that is just special, huh?

265
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,160
"拿"  你打算怎么拿走我的枪
"Take." How are you gonna take one of my guns?

266
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,640
来呀来  拿走我的枪
I mean, come on, billy jack-off, take my gun from me.

267
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,520
让我见识见识  来  送到你跟前
Let me see it. Here. I'll make it easy for you.

268
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,330
不用送到我跟前
You can make it not so easy.

269
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,400
好啊
Sure thing.

270
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,880
来吧
You got it.

271
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,900
靠  你个王八...
What the -- son of a --

272
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,410
好了  看看你都有什么好货
Okay, let's see what you got.

273
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,540
不错嘛
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

274
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,340
你这种人
I mean, a guy like you,

275
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,810
我打赌你脚踝也绑了枪  对吧
I'll bet you'd have an ankle holster, wouldn't you?

276
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,180
不错啊  还有什么
You know, that's cute. What else?

277
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,990
真是个宝贝
Now, that's impressive.

278
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,770
这么多枪  我都不知道选哪把好
So many guns, I don't know which one to use.

279
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,770
你呢  要来一把吗
How about you? You want one?

280
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,510
好了
All right.

281
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,730
我们走吧
Let's go.

282
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,400
可是我们需要三个人
But we need three guys.

283
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,070
不  不需要  来吧  走了
No. No, we don't. Come on. Let's go.

284
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,040
他没事
Ah, he'll be fine.

285
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,800
现在就剩我一个人了  那一千五都归我
And now that I'm doing the job alone, I get the full $1,500.

286
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,510
你没异议吧
Do we agree upon that?

287
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,980
当然
Sure.

288
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,610
你可以的  没问题
You got this, okay? No problem.

289
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,020
-我知道  -西装还合身吗
- Yes. - The suit okay?

290
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,070
-穿着紧不紧  热不热  -嗯
- Is it too tight or too hot? - Yeah.

291
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,440
不  我是说正合适
No, I mean -- no, no, no. It's -- it's good.

292
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,670
好了  你看起来很不错
Yeah, well, you look -- you look good.

293
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,140
根本看不出里面还套了太空服
Can't even tell that's under there.

294
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,050
这主意真棒
It was a good idea.

295
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,350
一旦你撑不住  不舒服的话
If at any point it's too much, you're uncomfortable,

296
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,560
我们就立马回家
we'll turn around and come home.

297
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,510
你要不要想个暗号
You want maybe like a safe word?

298
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,060
"快带我回家"怎么样
How about, "Get me the hell home"?

299

出发

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,480
天儿不错
Okay. Looking good.

302
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,970
我们就当是去兜个风
Just going for a little ride.

303
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,340
我来为你开车门
Here, let me get that for you.

304
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,310

Here you go.

305

00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,340
我去
Aw, crap.

307
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,520
怎么了
What is it?

308
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,760
我昨晚肯定忘关机了
I must have left my stupid phone on last night.

309
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,930
-没电了  -你能不能把它放后备箱里
- It's dead. - Well, could you put it in the trunk?

310
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,580
好的
Uh, yeah.

311
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,290
就这样吧
Okay, then.

312
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,730
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

313
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,460
收齐了吗
Is that everyone?

314
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,790
他马上就到
He'll be here in one minute.

315
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,580
还有人拿着手机吗  都放到里面
Anyone still have a phone, add it to the collection now.

316
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,180
-好了  关机吧  -好的  知道了
- Okay, shut it down. - Okay, got it.

317
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,150
你还好吧  没事儿吧
How you doing? You doing all right?

318
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,580
-还好  -那太好了
- Yeah, yeah. - Okay, great stuff.

319
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,560
好啦  迈步向前

320
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,810
进去吧  查克
Walking in, Chuck. Here we go.

321
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,180
见到你太好了  老朋友  欢迎回来
Good to see you, my friend. Welcome home.

322
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,810
霍华德  你不必这样大张旗鼓
Howard, you didn't need to do all this.

323
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,970
大家都情不自禁我也拦不住啊
Oh, I couldn't have stopped them if I'd wanted to.

324
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,020
来吧  我们上楼去
Come on. Let's get you upstairs.

325
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,650
好的  你好啊  法兰西斯
Yeah, sure. Hey, Francis.

326
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,690
布兰达
Brenda!

327
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,290
你刮胡子了啊
Oh, hey, you shaved.

328
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,120
目前为止  已经有六十八位原告
To date, we have 68 very willing plaintiffs

329
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,410
决意发起集体诉讼
signed to the class action

330
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:25,630
这个数字有望增加到三百五十或更多
with the hopes of raising that number to 350 or more.

331
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,150
还要多得多  我们现在知道
Many more now that we know

332
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,740
矶鹞渡在五个州都设有中心
Sandpiper has facilities in five states.

333
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,490
诈骗  不公平交易
Fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices,

334
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,040
还有敲诈勒索
and racketeering.

335
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,520
天啊  这真是...
Jesus. Guys, this is...

336
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,180
虽然任何官司都不简单
Well, no case is ever a slam dunk,

337
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,100
但我从来没有对一场官司
but I feel as confident about this

338
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,000
有如此大的信心
as anything that's ever come through our doors.

339
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,800
法兰西斯  组织一队人马去州外
Francis, start putting together teams to travel out of state,

340
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,770
跟这些老人谈谈
talk to these residents.

341
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,370
把四年员工和最好的两年员工两两组队
Pair some fourths with our best second years.

342
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,790
劳拉来安排行程
Laura will take care of the travel arrangements.

343
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,860
金和丹尼尔
Kim and Daniel,

344
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,840
你们去见吉米签的那些委托人
take the list of clients Jimmy's signed,

345
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,620
代表哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所去
introduce yourself as the face of HHM.

346
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,100
让他们感到安全  充满自信
Make them feel secure and confident.

347
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,710
霍华德  你这么激动我很高兴
Hey, Howard, I'm glad you're all excited,

348
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,050
不过  我们可以先谈谈条件吗
but, uh, can we slow down a second and discuss terms, maybe?

349
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,820
当然
Oh, uh, of course.

350
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,400
我有点迫不及待了
Kind of shot out of a canon with this case.

351
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,670
你这案子太激动人心了
It's exciting stuff you have here.

352
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,080
我知道
Hey, I get it.

353
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,200
查克已经是权益合伙人了
Look, Chuck is already an equity partner,

354
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,710
你呢  作为把这个官司带给我们的律师
and you, as the lawyer who brought this case to the firm,

355
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,520
我们可以保证给你...
we can guarantee you, say...

356
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,080
最终和解金共同基金份额的两成
...20% of the common-fund share of the final settlement.

357
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,520
那还不错
That will work.

358
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,010
那可能得好几年时间呢
That's a few years down the road.

359
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,230
至于现在给你的钱
As for money for you now,

360
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,900
因为我们是不支付介绍费的
uh, we don't do referral fees.

361
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,600
查克也同意
Chuck will agree.

362
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,650
律所认为介绍费不道德
HHM doesn't view that as ethical.

363
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,080
我们讨论过的
As we discussed.

364
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,660
但是我们可以按你已经投入的时间
But what we could do is arrange an of-counsel fee

365
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,540
付给你律师费
for the time that you've already put in --

366
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,610
你用来立案的时间
time that you spent building the case.

367
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,340
我想可以付给你两万吧
I think we could go as high as $20,000.

368
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,020
这也不错
That, too, will work.

369
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,460
成交
Great.

370
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,410
给我一张正式发票
Give us an official invoice,

371
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,550
我叫海伦给你开张支票
and I'll have Helen cut you a check.

372
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,200
就在这儿
Oh, got it right here.

373
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,580
我想要312室做我的办公室
And, uh, I'd like to use 312 as an office.

374
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,750
就在查克办公室旁边
It's right next to Chuck's.

375
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,370
-不好意思  -312室
- I'm sorry? - 312.

376
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,740
我知道  委托人喜欢那儿的风景
I know, it's got that view that the clients love,

377
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,640
不过你知道吗
but you know what?

378
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,900
那是浪费空间啊
That's a waste of space.

379
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,960
厨房边的等候区就足够好了
The waiting area by the kitchen is just as good.

380
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,720
得了  我只要一间办公室而已
Well, come on, guys. I mean, I need an office.

381
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,960
你们都先出去一下
Can I have the room?

382
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,310
都出去一下  请给我们几分钟
Everybody, please, just give us a few.

383
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,230
霍华德...  
Um, Howard...

384
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,150
等他们都走了再说  查克
When the room's clear, Chuck.

385
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,460
吉米...
Jimmy...

386
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,720
吉米  我还是直说了吧
Jimmy, I'm just gonna say it.

387
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,240
我们不会雇你
You're not working here.

388
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,800
你说什么
What are you talking about?

389
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,590
你说这场官司赢定了
You said this case is a slam dunk.

390
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,980
是的  我们想打这场官司
Yes. We want the case.

391
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,590
我们不想要...
Uh, we don't want, um...

392
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,900
我们只想要这个案子
The case is all we want.

393
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,870
你开什么...  你是认真的吗
You got to be -- you're serious?

394
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,890
我手捧白金盘子  向你奉上一个
I walk in here with a multimillion-dollar

395
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,770
价值数百万的集体诉讼案子
class-action lawsuit on a damn platinum platter...

396
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,590
案子是我发现的  诉讼也是我发起的
a-a case that I found, that I made happen,

397
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,880
而你居然不要我
and you don't want me?

398
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,110
到底为什么
W-why in Christ not?

399
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,970
我知道你讨厌我  霍华德
Well, I know that you hate me, Howard.

400
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:22,940
没事的
It's -- all right.

401
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,860
其实我也讨厌你
You better believe feeling goes both ways,

402
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,700
不过我愿意把私人感情撇开  跟你合作
but I'm willing to set that aside to work with you on this.

403
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,920
你怎么就不能跟我合作呢
Why can't you do the same for me?

404
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,510
到底是什么让你如此耿耿于怀
What is it that you can't let go of?

405
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,090
我到底如何侮辱了你优秀且正直的品行
What slight did I make to your fine, upstanding character

406
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,640
你竟无法原谅我
that you can't forgive?

407
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,180
这是我和我的合伙人大多数人的决定
A majority decision has been made by myself and the partners,

408
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,970
恕我冒昧  查克
all due respect to you, Chuck.

409
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,720
我们不会让任何新的律师加入律所
We are not taking in any new associates into the firm.

410
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
狗屁  什么新律师
Bullshit! "New associates"?!

411
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,790
如果别人拿着这个案子来找你
Someone walks in with a case like this,

412
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,670
你会求着他入伙
you beg them to be partner!

413
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,440
告诉我到底为什么
Tell me why!

414
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,070
以前你不肯要我  行  现在你也不要我吗
You didn't want me then, okay. You don't want me now?!

415
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,900
解释一下
Explain it.

416
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,100
霍华德
Howard.

417
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,340
我不知道该说什么
I-I don't know what to say.

418
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,460
我很失望
I am very disappointed.

419
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,450
我真的认为你该再考虑一下
I really think you should reconsider.

420
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,120
很抱歉  不行
I'm sorry, but no.

421
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,180
我认为吉米最好接受律师费
I think it's best if Jimmy takes the of-counsel fee.

422
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,430
我们可以多付他一些
We could probably up it a bit.

423
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,890
要记住  结案后你的酬劳会很高
Keep in mind, you will be well compensated in the back end.

424
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,370
这么好赚的钱  吉米  没理由拒绝的
It's easy money, Jimmy. No reason not to take it.

425
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,410
去死吧  霍华德
Go to hell, Howard.

426
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,380
我不会把案子给你的
I'm not giving you my case.

427
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,570
而且我会告诉那些委托人
And I'm gonna tell every one of those clients

428
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:38,000
你就是头满嘴谎言  卑鄙无耻的猪
what a lying, miserable pig fucker you are.

429
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,040
我就算把这案子毁了
I will burn the whole thing to the ground

430
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,560
也不会给你的
before I give it to you.

431
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,360
好吧  如果你意已决的话
Okay, then, if that's your decision.

432
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,080
祝你今后一切顺利
Good luck to you moving forward.

433
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,600
刚才是哪一出
What the hell just happened?

434
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,610
请进
Yeah, come.

435
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,390
你好
Hi.

436
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,580
你有空吗
Was wondering if you had a moment?

437
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,880
有  稍等一下
Sure. Just give me a second.

438
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,410
什么事
What's up?

439
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,750
我想跟你谈谈今天的事
I wanted to talk about what happened today.

440
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,560
矶鹞渡的案子没谈成
With Sandpiper Crossing. Things didn't work out.

441
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,290
很不幸
It was unfortunate.

442
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,710
那是个好案子  但木已成舟
It was a good case, but...things happen.

443
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,100
我只是想知道为什么
I'm just trying to understand why.

444
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,220
吉米发现了那个案子
Jimmy found that case.

445
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,540
他立案了  四处奔波搜集资料
He built it, did all of the legwork.

446
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,450
没有他就不会有这个集体诉讼
The class action doesn't exist without him.

447
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,290
他应该留下来工作
He deserves a seat at the table.

448
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,750
我明白  不过已经决定了  金...
I understand, but the decision has been made, Kim, so...

449
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,830
谢谢你的意见
Thank you for your input.

450
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,300
可是  为什么
B-- but...why?

451
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:21,030
合伙人已经做出了决定
The partners have made a decision,

452
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,380
至于原因跟你无关
and the "Why" is not your concern.

453
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,050
我觉得跟我有关
I think it is my concern.

454
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,340
为什么呢
And why is that?

455
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,280
因为他是我的朋友
Because he's my friend,

456
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,970
在我看来  你并没有公平对待他
and the way I see it, you're not treating him fairly.

457
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,390
那只是你的看法
The way you see it.

458
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,870
我不知道你对他有什么印象...
I don't know what image you have of him --

459
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,300
过去还是现在...
past or present --

460
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,610
或者他对你做了或说了什么
or whatever he did or said to you,

461
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,810
但吉米是个优秀的律师  而且他工作很努力
but Jimmy is a good lawyer and he works very hard.

462
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,300
是你朋友让你来跟我说这些的吗
Did your friend send you in here to say that?

463
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,460
不是
No.

464
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,160
这都是我自己的想法
I'm saying it because I believe it.

465
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,920
好吧  我知道了
Well, duly noted.

466
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,730
你知道我是怎么想的吗
Want to know what I believe?

467
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,340
我觉得你在这件事上管得也太宽了
I believe that you're way out of your depth in this matter.

468
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,860
以后你要是还想来我办公室
So, the next time that you want to come in here

469
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,910
指责我
and tell me what I'm doing wrong,

470
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,650
你最好把话留着说给自己听
you are welcome to keep it to yourself.

471
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,790
你的意见  我压根不在乎
Because I don't care.

472
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,260
等等
Stop.

473
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,010
把门关上
Close the door.

474
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,530
他们迟到了
They're late.

475
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,810
肯定是堵车了
Must be traffic.

476
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,320
等下我要怎么办
I wonder how this is supposed to work.

477
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,800
我是说  谁先来
I mean, who goes first?

478
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,810
是我先把药给他们呢
You know, do I hand over the pills first?

479
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,850
还是他们先给我钱  我再给他们药
Or do they give me the money and then I hand over the pills?

480
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,840
其实我觉得
I mean, I guess it makes sense

481
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,580
一手交钱一手交货才对
if we just exchanged at the same time, right?

482
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,580
那就公平多了
I mean, that's -- that's fair.

483
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,100
要不就数到三
I mean, just count to three.

484
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,510
你最好话少说点
Probably the less talk, the better.

485
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,830
是啊
Right.

486
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,060
我想
Yeah, I suppose --

487
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,780
碰到这种事情  谁都会多想
I suppose you could really over-think something like this.

488
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,910
是啊  无论如何...
Yeah. Well, in any case --

489
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,160
等下你就这么办
Here is what is going to happen.

490
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,210
你先问他们要钱  再数钱
You're gonna take the money. You're going to count it.

491
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,640
如果钱够数  就把药给他们
If it's all there, you hand them the pills.

492
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,190
就这么简单
Easy peasy.

493
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,020
我就知道得带三个人
I knew we needed three guys.

494
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,460
这本来就是三个人的活
I knew it. It's a three-man job.

495
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,020
老天
God.

496
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,320
你好啊
Hello. Hi.

497
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,400
东西带来了吗
Do you have it?

498
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,050
那你带...带钱了吗
Do you have -- do you have the money?

499
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,380
钱够吗
Is it all there?

500
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,310
那个  还  还少二十块
Uh, we're -- we're short $20 -- $20.

501
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,910
算了吧
That's fine.

502
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,660
把钱交齐  否则一切免谈
Agreed amount or no deal.

503
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,760
你说真的吗
You serious?

504
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,450
你觉得我故意少给你钱吗
You saying I intentionally shorted you?

505
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,990
当然不  犯错也是难免的
No. Mistakes happen.

506
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,900
就为区区二十块  连生意你都不做了吗
You're really willing to blow up this deal over 20 bucks?

507
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,150
那得看你做不做
Are you?

508
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,400
都在这儿了
It's all there.

509
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,550
八十毫克的药片  从没开过封
Uh, 80-milligram pills -- still factory-sealed.

510
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,410
现在该给我钱了吧
You can pay me now.

511
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,370
你...你怎么知道
So... h-how did you know?

512
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,610
你怎么知道不用带枪
How did you know not to bring a gun?

513
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,190
我就直说了  给我一千五
This $1,500 -- I'll just say it --

514
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,890
你这是拣了大便宜
You're getting a bargain.

515
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,090
来这儿之前我可是做足了功课
I put in a lot of legwork before coming here.

516
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,360
刚才那家伙叫伊格纳西奥·瓦尔加
Now, that fella you just met with, name is Ignacio Varga.

517
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,980
他和一帮毒贩一起干
He runs with a connected crew of drug dealers.

518
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,460
刚刚和你做的这笔生意
Now, this deal he's doing with you,

519
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,850
是他背着同伙做的
he's doing outside his crew.

520
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,610
他可不想被他老大发现
He doesn't want his bosses to know,

521
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:36,760
所以  他最怕出岔子
So it was in his best interest that things go very smoothly.

522
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,540
总结一下  要当罪犯  先得做点功课
The lesson is, if you're gonna be a criminal, do your homework.

523
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,720
等等  我可不是坏蛋
Wait. I-I'm not a bad guy.

524
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,560
我也没说你是坏蛋  我说你是罪犯
No, I didn't say you're a bad guy. I said you're a criminal.

525
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,560
有啥区别吗
What's the difference?

526
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,760
我见过好罪犯  坏警察
I've known good criminals and bad cops,

527
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,340
卑劣的牧师  高尚的小偷
bad priests, honorable thieves.

528
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,090
你或者守法  或者违法
You can be on one side of the law or the other,

529
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,250
但只要和别人做生意  就得遵守约定
but if you make a deal with somebody, you keep your word.

530
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,700
你这就可以拿钱回家  再也不干这种事
You can go home today with your money and never do this again,

531
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,210
但你到底是拿了本不属于你的东西
but you took something that wasn't yours,

532
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,850
还用它来卖钱
and you sold it for a profit.

533
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,810
所以你已经是个罪犯了  不过是好是坏
You're now a criminal -- good one, bad one?

534
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,200
就看你自己了
That's up to you.

535
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
我能弄到更多药
I -- I can get more pills.

536
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,670
那人肯定也会一直买
And I am sure that fella will keep buying.

537
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,660
开车回家吧
Why don't you get us home?

538
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,060
睡一觉再决定
You can sleep on it before you decide.

539
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,820
我很担心你
I was worried about you.

540
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,370
打了你十几通电话
I must have called a dozen times.

541
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,110
抱歉  我手机没电了
Sorry. My phone died.

542
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,150
住在查克家的一项特别待遇
It's one of the perks of living in Chuck-land --

543
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,520
没插座
nowhere to plug in.

544
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,520
但今晚在吉米家
But tonight -- it's Jimmy-land.

545
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,060
有杜松子酒  龙舌兰酒
I've got gin, I've got tequila,

546
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,420
还有上好的肯塔基波旁酒
I've got good Kentucky bourbon,

547
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,520
这些酒你随便挑
and you may partake with me in any beverage of your choice

548
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,150
只要你能听我痛骂
on one condition -- you have to listen to me rant

549
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,180
你老板是个不折不扣的王八蛋
about what an absolute unwashed asshole your boss is.

550
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,730
吉米
Jimmy.

551
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,740
这是事实  别为他辩白
No, nah, it's true. Don't deny it.

552
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,840
他已经傻逼到了
He has reached a level of douchebaggery

553
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,190
会遗传给后世子孙的程度
that will live on for generations --

554
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,060
被风语者代代相传
passed down by wind talkers and the like.

555
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,390
他宁愿让一个几百万的案子打水漂
He'd rather tank a multi-million-dollar case

556
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,360
也不愿跟我合作
than work with me.

557
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,750
有毛病  他脑子有病
That's -- that's sick. He has a sickness.

558
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,320
他这么讨厌我吗
No, he hates me that much?

559
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,380
我更讨厌他  你喝什么
I hate him more! What you drinking?

560
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,310
吉米
Jimmy.

561
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,560
没错  我想抓着他的针织领带
Yeah, I want to grab him by that stupid knit tie of his

562
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,880
把他甩飞
and swing him around.

563
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,650
-吉米  -"哈姆林靛蓝"
- Jimmy. - "Hamlindigo blue."

564
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,100
-不如叫"哈姆林舔烂我"  -吉米
- How about "Hamlindigo blow me"?! - Jimmy!

565
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,730
我觉得你应该接受他的条件
I think you should take the deal.

566
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,460
什么
What?

567
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,950
我觉得你该好好想一想
I think you should slow down and think about it

568
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,450
因为接受他的条件绝对是你最好的选择
because taking the deal really is the best thing for you.

569
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,180
你可以找间体面的办公室  自己的办公室
You'll find yourself a proper office -- your office.

570
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,890
积累实践经验
You'll build your practice.

571
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:45,520
不用理会哈姆林和他的律所
You'll leave Hamlin and HHM behind --

572
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,440
自己创业
be your own man.

573
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,740
你希望我放弃这个案子吗
You want me to give up the case?

574
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,410
我的案子
My case?

575
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,190
我希望你快乐
I want you to be happy.

576
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,400
我知道你放不下这个案子  但是...
And I know you want to stay with the case, but...

577
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,650
你可以毫无风险得到全部报酬
You'll get all the financial reward without the risk.

578
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,580
这能叫差吗
How can that be bad?

579
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,440
你来这里帮那个混蛋说话
You come here peddling that horseshit on me?

580
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,500
给你好处你就替他卖命是吧
God, you?! You sure know where your bread is buttered, huh?

581
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,900
你不愿意跟老板作对是吧
You don't want to go up against the boss. Is that it?

582
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,270
你简直  你简直就是他的走狗
You're like a -- you're like a damn pod person.

583
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,080
哈姆林答应你什么好处
What did Hamlin promise you?

584
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,350
别告诉我一点好处就把你收买了
Please, tell me he didn't buy you off cheap.

585
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,430
他承诺给你那间办公室了吗
Did he promise you the office I asked for?

586
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,270
还是发誓绝不把你轰下楼
Or did he just swear never to move you back downstairs?!

587
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,380
接受他的条件
Take the deal.

588
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,280
狗娘养的
Oh, son of a bitch.

589
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,040
吉米
Jimmy?

590
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,150
天  你什么时候进来的
Jesus, when did you come in?

591
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,970
不知道  我把表放在外面了
I don't know. I...left my watch outside.

592
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,870
大概一小时前来的吧
You know, maybe an hour ago.

593
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,870
你准备熨衣服吗
Are you doing some ironing?

594
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,130
没错  我...
Yeah, I...

595
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,780
我知道昨天事情不太顺利
Hey, I know things didn't go well for us yesterday,

596
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,170
但是  回办公室的感觉很不错
but, boy, being back in the office sure felt good.

597
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,470
相当棒
Really good.

598
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,120
万一我有更多活  我得做好准备
I want to be prepared in case any more work comes my way.

599
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,950
太空毯穿西装里面
And the space-blanket lining in the suit --

600
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,710
这主意真棒
what a fantastic idea.

601
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,380
走出家门再也不是煎熬了
It really made being outside m-much more tolerable.

602
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,530
待会我想在小区周围
I'm thinking about taking a little walk

603
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,280
散会儿步
around the block later on.

604
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,570
真棒  查克  你该出去转转
That's great, Chuck. You should do that.

605
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,350
吉米  你没事吧
Jimmy, are you all right?

606
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,280
我昨晚没睡
Well, I didn't sleep last night,

607
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,580
一直在思考
so just doing some soul searching,

608
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,600
我决定了
and I -- I came to a decision.

609
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,010
我接受哈姆林的条件
I'm gonna take that deal.

610
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,050
你确定
You're sure?

611
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,730
这是你想要的吗
This is what you want?

612
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,120
金找我谈了  我很生气
Kim talked to me. I got pretty nasty.

613
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,210
做这决定我并不自豪  但想想她说的话
I'm not proud, but thinking about what she said,

614
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,730
不要这笔钱我不成傻子了吗
I'd be a fool to pass up that money.

615
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,980
钱是不少
It is a lot of money.

616
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,320
我根本不想和霍华德合作
And I have zero interest in working with Howard,

617
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,960
所以我和他还是各做各的比较好
so it's probably best that we keep to our separate sandboxes.

618
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,490
希望一切顺利
Wish it could have worked out.

619
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,050
你能想象吗
Yeah. Imagine that, huh?

620
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,130
麦吉尔兄弟并肩跨入法庭大门
The two McGill boys side by side storming the gates,

621
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,690
弘扬正义  惩恶扬善
righting wrongs, taking down the bad guys,

622
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,790
而且还大把大把地赚钱
and making a boatload of money to boot.

623
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,390
实在是太棒了  不是吗
That would have been great, right?

624
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:03,720
最棒的
The very best.

625
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,180
-是啊  -是啊
- Yeah. - Yeah.

626
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,340
我来搞定霍华德
I'll keep on Howard.

627
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,180
我不会缠着他不放  但也许可以慢慢拖垮他
I won't badger him, but maybe I can gradually wear him down,

628
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,560
让他回心转意
You know, get him to come around.

629
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,260
真是  谢谢
That's -- thanks.

630
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,890
你真是
Wow, you...

631
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,670
有一个如此照顾我的哥哥真是太幸运了
I'm so lucky to have you looking out for me.

632
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,010
我尽量  没说一定能成
I'll do what I can. I'm not promising anything.

633
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,430
我懂  没那么容易
No, I get it. It's a long shot.

634
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,860
他可能会改变主意
Hey, he might change his mind.

635
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,070
是啊
Yeah.

636
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,840
也许你有办法
Hey, maybe there is a way

637
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,990
能让霍华德改变主意
that you could get Howard to change his mind.

638
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,720
-什么办法  -辞职
- How? - Quit.

639
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,760
-吉米  不行  -不  这很完美
- Jimmy, n-no. No, no, no. - No, no, it's -- it's perfect.

640
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,050
我们已经谈过了
We've already been through all of this,

641
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,080
我跟你说了我不会离开律所
all -- all the reasons I'm never gonna leave HHM.

642
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,090
不不  但你不是真的退出
No, no. You -- but you don't have to really quit.

643
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,840
你只是威胁要退出
Okay, you just threaten to quit, right?

644
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,810
你就跟霍华德来一场博弈
You get in a game of chicken with Howard.

645
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,740
他不得不让步  不然律所就会垮
He's got to blink, or HHM goes under.

646
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,200
这计划太棒了
It's -- it's a perfect plan.

647
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,960
-吉米  -如果你希望
- Jimmy -- - If that's what you want,

648
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,860
咱俩能一起工作
you know, u-us working together.

649
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,850
你可以轻而易举地实现
You can make it happen -- easily.

650
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,670
我是说
I mean, hey.

651
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,110
昨天你在律所受到的接待
That reception you got yesterday at HHM --

652
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,100
感觉怎么样
How about that, right?

653
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,900
所有人都为你鼓掌
The whole lobby of HHM applauding for you.

654
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,690
他们爱你
They love you!

655
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,300
现在你威胁要退出
Now, you threaten to pull out --

656
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,550
哈姆林绝对不敢惹毛你
Hamlin would be insane to screw with you.

657
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,510
你手上可拿着杀手锏呢
You've got the nuclear option.

658
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,330
一旦你按下发射键
Launch the doomsday device.

659
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,490
他们就玩完了
Game over --

660
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:35,390
如果你真想跟我一起工作的话
If working with me is what you really want.

661
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:36,790
怎么样  查克
Right, Chuck?

662
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,470
是你打电话给他
You called him.

663
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,460
是你打给哈姆林
You called Hamlin.

664
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,640
我把手机放进邮箱之前都会关机
I always turn my phone off before I put it in your mailbox.

665
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,090
两晚前  手机是开着的  第二天没电了
Two nights ago, it was left on -- battery drained.

666
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,360
而且我十分确定把它关了
And I was so damn sure that I turned it off,

667
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,790
因为我一直这么干
you know, 'cause I always do.

668
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,220
这是习惯
It's a habit, right?

669
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,820
所以我就在琢磨  一直在想
So, it was nagging me. It was nagging me!

670
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,600
所以我打给电话公司
So I called the phone company.

671
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:08,150
结果发现当晚两点有一条被删除的通话记录
Turns out, there was a deleted call at 2:00 A.M.,

672
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,080
那时候我就在那儿睡觉
when I was asleep right there.

673
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,320
你知道是打给谁的吗
And you know who's number?

674
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,170
哈姆林
Hamlin's.

675
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,100
唯一能播出这个电话
The only person who could have made that call

676
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,640
并删除记录的人就是你  查克
and deleted it is you, Chuck.

677
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,640
好家伙  打电话啊
Boy, that phone, huh?

678
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,160
手机对你来说应该像个酒精喷灯一样烫手啊
Phone must have felt like a blowtorch in your ear.

679
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,710
那些电流  还有那些在你脑边
All that electricity, all those radio waves

680
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,120
萦绕不去的无线电波
right up against the side of your head?

681
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,180
天哪
My god.

682
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,780
什么事这么重要
What was so important

683
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,070
让你在会面之前必须打给霍华德
that you had to call Howard before our meeting?

684
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,690
我能想到的唯一一件事  唯一说得通的
The only thing I can think, the only thing that makes sense

685
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,370
就是你告诉他不要雇我
is you told him not to hire me.

686
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,560
一直都是你  对吗
It was always you, right?

687
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,490
从我通过律师考试
Right back to when I passed the bar

688
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,810
想要加入律所开始
and tried to join the firm.

689
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,130
你就不想雇我
You didn't want me.

690
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,640
说出来
Speak up.

691
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,950
告诉我为什么
Tell me why.

692
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,410
你现在起码可以给我一个解释
It's the least you can do for me now.

693
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,840
我是你亲弟弟
I'm your brother.

694
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,890
我们应该照顾彼此的
We're supposed to look out for each other.

695
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,370
你为什么要跟我作对  查克
Why were you working against me, Chuck?

696
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,800
你不是个真正的律师
You're not a real lawyer.

697
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,630
什么
I'm what?

698
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,610
你不是个真正的律师
You're not a real lawyer!

699
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,060
美属萨摩亚大学  我的老天
University of American Samoa, for Christ sake?

700
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,800
在线学习  简直是笑话
An online course? What a joke.

701
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,490
我付出了多少努力才到现在的地位
I worked my ass off to get where I am,

702
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,200
而你走了这些捷径
and you take these shortcuts and you think,

703
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,710
就能变成我的同事吗
suddenly, you're my peer?

704
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,590
你跟我一样当律师  就因为你很幽默吗
You do what I do because you're funny

705
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,740
你能让别人发笑吗
and you can make people laugh?

706
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,950
我为这事业付出了一切
I committed my life to this.

707
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,330
绝对不能让你这么容易就掺和进来
You don't slide into it like a cheap pair of slippers

708
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,480
抢走所有的功劳
and then reap all the rewards.

709
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,690
我还以为你为我骄傲
I thought you were proud of me.

710
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,230
我确实为你骄傲
I was!

711
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:53,500
你金盆洗手后到收发室工作
When you straightened out and got a job in the mailroom,

712
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,220
我感到非常骄傲
I was very proud.

713
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:56,690
所以就应该那样是吗
So that's it then, right?

714
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,420
让老吉米待在收发室
Keep old Jimmy down in the mailroom

715
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,030
因为他没资格成为一名律师
'cause he's not good enough to be a lawyer.

716
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,030
我了解你
I know you.

717
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,740
我了解你的过去  你的现在
I know what you were, what you are.

718
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,380
人不会改变的  你是"风流吉米"
People don't change. You're slippin' Jimmy.

719
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,550
风流吉米我能接受
And slippin' Jimmy I can handle just fine,

720
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,120
但再加上一个法律学位
but slippin' Jimmy with a law degree

721
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,180
就像猩猩拿着一把机关枪
is like a chimp with a machine gun.

722
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,760
法律是神圣的
The law is sacred!

723
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,670
如果你滥用权力  会伤害别人的
If you abuse that power, people get hurt.

724
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,290
这不是一场游戏
This is not a game.

725
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,090
你得知道  在某种程度上
And you have to know, on -- on some level,

726
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,090
你也知道我是对的
I know you know I'm right.

727
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,810
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.

728
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,320
我
I...

729
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,630
我给你买了一包二十磅的冰
I got you a 20-pound bag of ice

730
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,480
一些培根和鸡蛋
and some bacon and some eggs

731
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,060
几块你喜欢吃的牛排
and a couple of those steaks that you like

732
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,950
还有一些燃料罐
and some fuel cannisters.

733
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:51,140
够你用三四天的
It's enough for three or four days.

734
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,440
之后你就要靠自己了
After that, you're on your own.

735
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,370
我受够了
I am done.

736
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:00,600
吉米
Jimmy.

737
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,280
吉米
Jimmy.

738
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,430
吉米
Jimmy!

739
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,080
吉米  回来
Jimmy, come back inside.

740
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,210
吉米
Jimmy!

741
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,770
吉米
Jimmy.
