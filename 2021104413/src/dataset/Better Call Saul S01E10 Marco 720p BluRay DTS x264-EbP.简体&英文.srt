00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,480
怎么可能成功
It can't be done.

20
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,270
你确定吗
You sure about that?

21
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,330
动了手脚吧
There's a trick?

22
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,720
肯定是
There's got to be.

23
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,730
如果没有动手脚
This guy wouldn't be putting any money

24
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,320
这人怎么会拿钱出来
on it unless there's a trick?

25
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,670
我说了  这不可能成功
I'm telling you -- it can't be done.

26
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,750
所以你放弃了
So you give up?

27
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,280
那好吧
Yeah, all right.

28
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,510
-等等  -没搞错吧
- Wait. What? - No way!

29
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,410
再来一次
Show me that again.

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,170
没问题  再出二十吧
Sure. You got another $20?

31
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,130
去你的
Screw this.

32
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,260
别生气啊
Don't go away mad.

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,810
你们想买劳力士表吗
Oh, hey, guys, you want to buy a Rolex?

34
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,190
等等
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

35
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,000
那块冒牌表要卖多少钱
How much for that cheap piece of crap?

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,970
-看看是谁来了  -莫娜
- Look what the wind blew in. - Hey, Merna.

37
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,020
没搞错吧
Holy crap.

38
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,980
吉米  我就说你能脱罪
Jimmy, my man, I said you would beat the rap.

39
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,000
莫娜  给他倒杯酒
Hey, Merna, set him up, would you?

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,270
不了  莫娜  谢谢
Merna, no, thanks. I'm good.

41
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,810
给他满上  他其实想喝
No, go on. He don't mean it.

42
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,430
你刚刚出狱啊
You just got out of jail. Come on.

43
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,590
连酒都不喝一杯吗
You're, you're not gonna have a drink?

44
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,500
怎么可能啊
That'll be the day?

45
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,650
马可  别嚷了  我赶时间
Marco, settle down, okay? I'm in a rush.

46
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,690
我哥在外面的出租车里  计费表还跳着呢
My brother's outside in a taxi. The meter's running.

47
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,300
查克在外面
What, Chuck's outside?

48
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,880
让他别磨叽了
Tell him to pull that broomstick out of his ass

49
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,060
进来喝酒  我请客
and get in here. I'm buying.

50
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,310
不  我们没时间了  要赶飞机
No. No, no, we got no time. We're catching a plane.

51
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,090
我是来告别的
I came here to say goodbye.

52
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,800
我要搬去新墨西哥州的阿尔布开克
I'm moving to Albuquerque, New Mexico.

53
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,250
墨西哥  你要弃保潜逃吗
Mexico? You skipped bail?

54
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,060
是"新"墨西哥
New Mexico--

55
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,290
就是兔八哥和BB鸟在的那个地方
you know, like, uh, Bugs Bunny and the Road Runner, you know?

56
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,780
你要去那干什么
Yeah. What are you gonna do there?

57
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,250
在我哥的律所打杂  在收发室干活
I'm gonna work at his law firm, like, in the mailroom.

58
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,470
算是个新开始吧
It's a start, anyways.

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,320
你没搞错吧  老兄
What? N-now you're talking crazy, man.

60
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,980
你才出狱  就又想进去了
You just got out of jail. Now you want to go back?

61
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,120
给他工作等于坐牢啊
Because working for him, that's all that is.

62
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,730
马可  我别无他法了
Marco...I was done.

63
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,830
你懂吗  我没有逃脱制裁
You understand? I didn't beat the rap.

64
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,490
是查克赶来救了我
Chuck flew in and saved my ass.

65
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,340
是时候改变自己了
It's time to make some changes.

66
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,260
你可是"风流吉米"啊
Hey, listen, man. You're Slipping Jimmy.

67
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,150
你要改变什么
What do you got to change?

68
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,060
洗心革面  是时候长大了
Everything. It's time to grow up.

69
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,640
这又是谁说的  查克吗
Yeah, according to who, Chuck?

70
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,540
你也是一样  兄弟
The same goes for you, man.

71
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,350
你想一辈子都坐在这凳子上吗
You want to spend the rest of your life on that stool?

72
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,200
马可  看看你自己
I mean, come on, Marco. Look at yourself.

73
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,330
他在催我了  我得走了
All right, that's him. I got to hit it.

74
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,460
是啊  主人在召唤你呢
Geez. His master's voice.

75
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,670
-有必要吗  -你出去吧
- Really? - Look, come on. Go outside.

76
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,370
跟查克说你还有事忘了做
Tell Chuckles that you, you got some business you forgot.

77
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,630
-马可  -得了
- Marco. - Come on.

78
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,400
你好歹得干最后一票
Y-you got to have one last blowout.

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,240
我们再玩儿一次手表把戏
W-we'll do the watch thing again,

80
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,980
你之前说的那个...
but, but maybe we'll pull that--

81
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,230
那个骗钱圈套也不错
that tar-money scam you were talking about,

82
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,480
-约几个美女  -我答应他了
- get some girls... - I made a promise.

83
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,740
你是答应他了  但这是...
Yeah, you made a promise, but it was --

84
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,080
律师管这叫啥  受到胁迫
W-w-what do you might call it? Under duress.

85
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,520
他把你从监狱里捞了出来
Look, he got you out of jail, okay?

86
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,810
但他是你哥哥  他还能逼你不成
But he's your brother. I mean, what else is he gonna do?

87
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,340
马可  听我说
Marco, listen to me, all right?

88
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,190
不是查克逼我这么做的
Chuck's not making me do this.

89
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,840
他这是给我一个机会  我要抓住机会
He's giving me an opportunity, and I'm grabbing it.

90
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,550
就像迈尔斯·戴维斯放弃吹小号一样
Geez, it's like watching Miles Davis give up the trumpet.

91
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,550
{\an8}著名音乐家

92
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,180
这是什么意思
What? What does that even mean?

93
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,150
简直是浪费你的天赋
It's just a waste, is all I'm saying.

94
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,270
我要飞去那里了
All right, look. I'm gonna fly out there.

95
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,140
等我安定下来  再打给你
I'm gonna get settled, and I'll call you. Yeah?

96
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,100
好吧  吉米
All right, Jimmy.

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,840
祝你一路平安
Hey, have a safe flight, all right?!

98
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,360
怎么了
What's up?

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,500
等着跟霍华德谈话
Just waiting to talk to Howard.

100
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,900
能问问谈什么吗
Can I ask about what?

101
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,790
我决定听你的
I'm taking your advice.

102
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,650
把案子给哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
I'm giving the case to HHM.

103
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,460
为什么
Why?

104
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,810
大概是因为
The fact that Chuck doesn't

105
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,090
查克不想让我在这里工作吧
want me here has something to do with it.

106
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,670
真抱歉
I'm so sorry.

107
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,930
你为什么不早告诉我呢
Why didn't you just tell me?

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,170
我只是
I just...

109
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,430
我不想让你恨你哥哥
I didn't want you hating your own brother.

110
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,760
你是怎么发现的
How did you find out?

111
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,530
是金告诉你的吗
Did Kim tell you?

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,670
我自己弄明白了
I figured it out on my own.

113
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,150
也该弄明白了  对吧
It's about time, right?

114
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,030
我把矶鹞渡的文件拿来了
I brought the Sandpiper stuff with me.

115
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,500
就在我车里
It's down in my car.

116
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,250
你们可以主动扩大业务
I figure your guys could do the outreach.

117
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,420
如果那些老年人不想签你们
If any of those geezers don't want to sign with you,

118
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,480
把他们的名字给我
just give me their names.

119
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,110
我会劝他们签的
I'll talk them into it.

120
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,700
吉米  我真的不想让事情变成这个样子
You know, Jimmy, I never wanted it to go this way.

121
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,150
如果我说了算  我们至少会
If it had been up to me, we would have at least--

122
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,820
霍华德  我懂
Howard, I get it.

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,390
你哥哥对律所来说非常重要
Your brother's very important to the firm.

124
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
抱歉我当时说你是个混蛋
Sorry I called you a pigfucker.

125
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,370
我们还欠了你钱  不是吗
We owe you some money, don't we?

126
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,490
律师费  我记得是两万美金
The of-counsel fee -- I think we discussed $20,000.

127
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,120
再加上矶鹞渡一案的共同基金
That and whatever the common-fund proceeds

128
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,220
不管最终金额有多少
of Sandpiper ultimately adds up to,

129
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,840
你都会拿到两成
you'll receive 20% of that --

130
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,760
应该是一笔很可观的收入
Should be a very nice payday for you when it comes.

131
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,690
没错
Yep.

132
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,380
我还给你准备了些东西
I've got something for you, too.

133
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,670
是给查克准备的购物清单
Uh, it's a shopping list for Chuck.

134
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,090
他现在是好多了
I mean, he's doing better,

135
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,840
但他每天还是需要一些东西
but he still needs deliveries every day.

136
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,360
我觉得最好还是由别人来做
I think he'd be more comfortable with someone else doing it.

137
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,410
我知道了
I see.

138
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,940
你不需要亲自上门
You don't have to do it personally.

139
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,350
只要做好就行
It just needs to get done.

140
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,870
写得非常清楚了
It's pretty straightforward.

141
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,160
冰块倒是件麻烦事  但这是必需品
The ice is a pain in the ass, but he needs it.

142
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,230
我经常会溜进小旅馆里塞个一整包
I usually sneak into a motel and fill a garbage bag,

143
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,790
但你可以叫你的手下花钱买就好
but you can have whoever you hire just buy it.

144
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,860
最重要的是报纸
The most important thing is the newspapers.

145
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,830
《纽约时报》  还有《华尔街日报》
Uh, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal --

146
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,910
这些都是必需品
They're a must.

147
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,210
尤班克那边有个报摊
There's a newsstand on Eubank

148
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,780
早上六点就有卖
that has both of them at 6:00 A.M.,

149
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,650
他习惯早起  所以一早给他比较好
which is good 'cause he's an early riser.

150
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,450
他订了《阿尔布开克日报》
The Albuquerque Journal he gets delivered,

151
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,750
但得有人把报纸带进屋
but somebody still has to bring it in for him.

152
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,130
你每天都做这些事吗
You've been doing all of this every day...

153
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,010
做了一年多吗
For over a year?

154
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,200
你会处理好这些事吗
You'll take care of this?

155
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,980
当然了
Absolutely.

156
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,840
肯定做得滴水不漏
I'll get it done and done right.

157
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,530
我一直很喜欢你  吉米
I always liked you, Jimmy.

158
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,370
记得吗
Remember?

159
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,010
我以前叫你"骗子查理"
I used to call you "Charlie Hustle."

160
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,620
我记得
Yeah, I remember that.

161
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,720
对不起  之前冲你大喊大叫
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

162
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,450
抱抱你真不错
That was nice.

163
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,020
你确定你没事吗
You sure you're all right?

164
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,460
发泄出来吧  没事的
It's not a crime to let it out.

165
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,590
没什么好发泄的  查克脑子有病
There's nothing to let out. Chuck's a sick man.

166
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,070
那不是借口
That's no excuse.

167
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,220
他是我哥哥
He's my brother.

168
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,960
他觉得我是个混球
He thinks I'm a scumbag.

169
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,980
我没法让他改变看法
There's nothing I can do to change that.

170
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,100
我还能说什么
What else is there to say?

171
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,440
你真是太成熟了
Wow. That's mature.

172
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,490
达赖喇嘛也比不上我
Dalai Lama's got nothing on me.

173
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,320
O64  就是
O-64, as in,

174
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,860
"哦  又是64"
"Oh, to be 64 again!"

175
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,110
O64
O-64.

176
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,200
好吧
All right.

177
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,790
下一个号码是  N32
Next up...we got...N-32.

178
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,310
南希·里根的首字母哦

时髦的第一夫人
A first lady with a lot of style.

180
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,350

{\an8}1957年电影  由里根夫妇主演

182
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,260
好吧  还是没人赢吗
All right. No winners yet?

183
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,300
好吧  现在是
Okay, here's...

184
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,430
B2  就是B2轰炸机
B-2, just like the B-2 bomber,

185
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,740
隐形机
The stealth --

186
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,880
说不定现在柯特兰空军基地就有一架起飞
There's probably one taking off over at Kirtland right now.

187
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,050
反正是隐形的  咱们也看不见
We would never know because it's stealthy.

188
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,110
还是没人赢吗  真的吗
Still no winners? No?

189
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,420
现在是
Here we have...

190
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,660
B4  又来个B打头的  怎么样
...B-4, another "B." How about that?

191
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,050
"不久之后  就会又有一名赢家"
As in, "Before too long, we're gonna have another winner."

192
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,690
还是没有吗  好吧
No? Nobody? Okay.

193
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,020
好吧
All right.

194
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,730
接下来是
And here comes...

195
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,090
咱们的老朋友B
Hey, it's our old friend "B."

196
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,260
B12
B-12.

197
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,370
B开头的...
"B," As in, uh...

198
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,760
B开头的...
"B," As in...

199
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,640

200
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,440
本尼迪克特·阿诺德背叛了美国
Benedict Arnold betrayed the United States.

201

{\an8}美国独立战争时期军官  后变节投靠英军

202
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,350
还是没有胜利者吗
Still no winners.

203
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,270
没有吗
No?

204
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,110
好的
Okay.

205
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,190
下一个
Here it is.

206
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,030
多巧啊
Oh, what are the odds?

207
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,960
连来四个B  真是...
Four B's in a row That's...

208
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,310
B7
B-7.

209
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,210
B开头的...
"B" As in...

210
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,070
B开头的...兄弟  兄弟
"B" As in..."brother" -- brother.

211
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,710
B7  七个兄弟七个新娘
B-7 -- "Seven brides for seven brothers."

212
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,070
我相信你们很多人都有兄弟
I'm sure a lot of you have brothers.

213
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,800
但肯定和我兄弟不一样
It's not like mine, though.

214
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,190
有人赢了吗
Any winners yet?

215
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,950
再...再看看  行吗
Take a -- take another look, okay?

216
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,970
我等着
I'll wait.

217
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,030
我要说的是...
All I'm gonna say is,

218
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,060
如果又是个B  那就出问题了
if it's another "B," could have a real problem here.

219
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,720
接下来
And...

220
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,810
又是一个B
Hey, it is another "B."

221
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,210
B5  开头的...
B-5, as in,

222
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,470
"用B造句真是让我快疯了"
"Boy, this 'b' thing is really starting to tick me off."

223
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,560
B打头的"战舰"  B打头的"波旁酒"
"B" As in "Battleship." "B" As in "Bourbon."

224
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,180
B打头的"伯利兹"  听说是个很美的地方
"B" As in "Belize" -- beautiful place, so I've heard.

225
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,980
我很想去那里
I would love to go there.

226
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,930
但咱们还是直面现实吧  那不可能
But, uh, let's face it -- that's never gonna happen.

227
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,030
咱们没人能离开这该死的荒漠
None of us is ever leaving this godforsaken wasteland.

228
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,090
不好意思
Sorry.

229
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,970
你们当没听到  咱们继续玩
Scratch that. Moving on.

230
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,460
这鬼地方到底怎么了
I mean, what is it with this place?

231
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,950
感觉像是在一个烤箱里
It's -- it's like living inside an easy-bake oven.

232
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,380
你们往窗外看看
I mean, look out that window.

233
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,000
外面简直就像
It's -- it's like a soulless,

234
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,840
乔治亚·欧姬芙描绘的毫无生气的地狱
radioactive Georgia O'Keeffe hellscape out there,

235
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,840
{\an8}20世纪美国艺术家

236
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,580
爬满了珊瑚蛇和蝎子以及...
crawling with coral snakes and scorpions and...

237
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,740
你们没看过《隔山有眼》吗
You ever see the movie "The Hills Have Eyes"?

238
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,740
{\an8}恐怖片  核辐射杀人狂魔的故事
够胆你就看

239
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,070
那简直就是个记录片
It's a documentary!

240
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,920
你的车突然抛锚了
God forbid your car breaks down --

241
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,360
你不得不下车步行
you have to walk 10 steps.

242
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,740
你的脑袋变成了
You got a melanoma the size of

243
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,900
一个菠萝那么大的黑瘤子
a pineapple where your head used to be.

244
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,480
你问我"为什么会这样"  为什么
And so you ask, "Why?" Why?

245
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,770
如果我感觉这么糟  为什么还待在这
If -- if that's how I feel, why do I live here?

246
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,790
是啊  为什么
Why?!

247
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,380
不好意思
Excuse me.

248
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,420
你还说不说数字了
Are you gonna read that number?

249
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,940
说  我这就告诉你
Yeah. I'm gonna read your number.

250
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,740
又是一个B
And it's another "B."

251
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,440
又是一个该死的B  当然是B
It's another frigging "B." Boy, of course.

252
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,580
为什么不是B呢
Why not? Why not?!

253
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,690
下一个数字是...
And the next number...

254
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,720
问个小问题
Uh, quick question --

255
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,970
谁知道"芝加哥天窗"是什么吗
who here knows what a Chicago Sunroof is?

256
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,970
{\an8}请参见第三集  致使吉米被捕的"小把戏"

257
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,110
有人知道吗
Anybody?

258
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,700
你知道吗  不知道  好吧
You, sir? No? Okay.

259
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,010
讲个真事  我老家那边有个叫切特的人
True story -- uh, back home, uh, there was this guy named Chet.

260
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,100
他是个大混蛋
Now, Chet was a real asshole.

261
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,710
他可能欠我的钱
He might have owed me some money.

262
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,040
也可能睡了我老婆...
He might have slept with my wife...

263
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,310
然后我老婆就变成了我前妻
before she became my ex-wife.

264
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,880
细节不重要
The details don't matter.

265
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,060
总之  我被冤枉了
Suffice it to say, I was wronged.

266
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,410
那是一个夏日夜晚
All right, so, one summer evening,

267
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,040
我出去喝了几杯  一杯两杯或者三杯
I was out having a few drinks -- one or two, maybe three.

268
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,430
你们懂的
You get the picture?

269
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,830
猜我这时候看到谁了  切特
And, uh, who do I see? Chet.

270
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,680
他开车过来  把车并排停在了
He drove up, and he double-parked

271
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,650
冰雪皇后门口  然后进去买冰淇淋了
outside a Dairy Queen and went in to get some soft-serve.

272
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,310
切特开的车可以说明
Now, Chet drove -- and this will give you an idea

273
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,300
他是一个彻头彻尾的混蛋
of exactly what kind of a douchebag this guy was --

274
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,710
他开着一辆珍珠白宝马7系
drove a white pearlescent BMW 7 series

275
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,640
内饰也是白色皮革的
with white leather interior.

276
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,500
我看到了他的车
So, I saw that thing,

277
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
我突然灵机一动  像我之前说的
and I had -- I'd had a few, like I said.

278
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,510
我爬到了车顶
And, uh... I climbed up top,

279
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,050
可能...
and I may have...

280
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,880
对着天窗拉了泡屎
defecated, uh, through the sunroof.

281
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
我并不引以为豪
Not my finest hour -- I'll grant you that.

282
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,930
这就是"芝加哥天窗"的含义
But that's what a Chicago Sunroof is.

283
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,810
现在你们知道了  这是个真实的故事
Now you know. It's a real thing.

284
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,310
不是我编的  我也不是第一个做这种事的
I didn't make it up. I'm not the first person to do it.

285
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,620
它是有专门名字的
There's a name for it.

286
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,680
他想要一些冰淇淋  那我就给他一些冰淇淋
Guy wanted some soft-serve -- I gave him some soft-serve.

287
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,130
我根本不知道他的孩子坐在车后座上
I did not know that his children were in the backseat.

288
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,150
他那车窗不是透明的
There was a level of tint on the windows

289
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,930
至今我仍认为
that I'll maintain to this day

290
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,100
这在伊利诺伊州的车上是违法的
was not legal in an Illinois-licensed vehicle.

291
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,900
但不知怎么的  这变成了我的错
But somehow, that's on me, I guess.

292
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,580
谁会把车停在路边  不熄火
Who leaves two cub scouts in a double-parked car

293
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,060
还让两个孩子待在里面啊
with the engine running?!

294
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,940
拜托
Come on.

295
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,580
切特人脉很广
Now, Chet was connected, see?

296
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,380
在西塞罗混得人熟
Like, uh, Cicero connected.

297
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,730
通常情况  我会被指控故意损害他人财产
So, usually, I'd be looking at malicious mischief,

298
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,150
公共场所酗酒  妨碍社会治安  都有可能
public intoxication, disorderly conduct, maybe,

299
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,250
可是切特却让检察官指控我是个露阴癖
but he's got the D.A. saying indecent exposure,

300
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,840
把我说成是性侵犯

只是个小小的天窗恶作剧

302
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,890
突然间我就跟查尔斯·曼森[杀人狂]一样了
and suddenly I'm Charles Manson?!

303
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,020
从那以后一切都失控了
And that's where it all went off the rails.

304
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,900
我一直在为此付出代价
I've been paying for it ever since.

305
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,580
这就是我为什么沦落到这
That's why I'm here!

306
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,050
我不
I don't...

307
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,600
你们猜怎么着
You know what?

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,050
她是我继母
She's my stepmom.

318
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,180
她不常来了
She don't come in much anymore.

319
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,680
跟她说风流吉米向她问好
Tell her Slippin' Jimmy says hello.

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,610
她知道的
She'll know.

322
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,610
我会告诉她的
I'll tell her.

我还不够黑是吗

不不  我只是说你肤色没黑

土耳其人  他们给了我一堆财宝

-人民的河流  -人民的河流
- river to my people! - ...river to my people!

338
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,850
我可是爱尔兰人
Well, hey, I'm irish, okay?

339
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,930
我可不待在太阳底下
I spend my time staying out of the sun.

340
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,870
说起脸色苍白的混蛋
Speaking of pale sons of bitches,

341
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,060
你哥哥怎么样了
how's your brother doing?

342
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,010
查克很好
Chuck's fine.

343
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,430
你还在给他工作吗
Still working for him?

344
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,920
有时候吧
Sometimes.

345
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,940
你呢  除了周三下午四点
What about you -- I mean, besides falling asleep on a bar

346
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,950
在酒吧睡觉以外还干嘛
at 4:00 on a Wednesday afternoon?

347
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,430
"密歇根湖竖管公司"
"Lake Michigan Standpipe"?

348
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,830
-那是什么  -我姐夫的公司
- What's that? - My brother-in-law owns the company.

349
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,220
等等  你结婚了
Wait. Hold it. You got married?

350
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,820
不不  我姐姐安吉的丈夫
No, no, no. My -- my -- my sister Angie's husband.

351
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,260
竖管是个什么东西
So, what the hell's a standpipe?

352
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,540
你知道的啊
Standpipe -- you know what a standpipe is.

353
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,030
-我不知道  -消防队来了
- I don't think so. - Fire department comes.

354
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,770
他们把水管的一端接到消防栓上
They stick one end of the hose on the hydrant.

355
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,210
另一端接到竖管上
The other end goes on the standpipe.

356
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,020
水从竖管中出来
The water goes out the standpipe,

357
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,590
经过喷头  然后灭火
through the sprinklers, and then douses the flames.

358
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,920
这是很重要的东西
It's important stuff.

359
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,120
这就是竖管吗
So, that's what a standpipe is, huh?

360
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,090
这只是干式竖管  还有湿式竖管
Well, it's a dry standpipe. There's also the wet standpipe.

361
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,650
有什么区别
What's the difference?

362
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,110
我不知道怎么跟外行人解释
I don't know i-if I could explain it to a layman.

363
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,670
不好意思  你妈妈还好吗
Excuse me. How's your mom?

364
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,440
她三年前就去世了
Oh, she passed away about three years ago.

365
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,190
真可惜  她是位了不起的女士
Ah. That's too bad. She was a great lady.

366
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,950
-是啊  -她是威斯康星州的  对吧
- Yeah. - From Wisconsin, right?

367
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,750
-对啊  -葬礼也是在那儿办的吗
- Yeah. - The funeral out there?

368
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,210
不  就在这儿办的
No, it was...here.

369
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,510
这里吗
Here?

370
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,650
是的  我们只在镇上呆了几天  所以...
Yeah, well, we were only in town for a few days, so...

371
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,390
你回来了怎么不找我
You were in town. You didn't look me up?

372
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,110
查克当时正在打一个大官司
Chuck was in the middle of a big case,

373
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,930
所以我们不能呆太久  所以...
and, uh, we couldn't stay around, so...

374
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,150
你们还要点别的吗
Can I get you guys anything else?

375
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,000
我不用了  你呢
I'm good. You want anything?

376
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,120
-不了  -给您的找零
- Nah. - Your change here, too.

377
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,750
好的
Uh, yeah, okay. Hey.

378
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,920
谢谢
Thank you.

379
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,890
我的短剑汽车还好吧
How's my Cutlass running?

380
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,680
我一直开着呢
Gets me around.

381
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,510
那可是经典款啊
Well, it's a classic.

382
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,230
只要车身稍微上点漆  简直帅呆了
Little bodywork, paint job -- really be something.

383
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,510
那你这次回来是做什么呢
So, what you gonna do while you're here?

384
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,230
我也不知道
I don't know.

385
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,900
看看风景吧
See the sights, you know,

386
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,780
去看台上看个球赛
Catch a cubbies game from the bleachers,

387
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,510
去亨利店里吃个热狗
Get a hot dog at Henry's.

388
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,650
对  对
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

389
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,570
正确
Correct.

390
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,460
我明天去见他们
I'm gonna see them tomorrow.

391
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,030
是的  他们俩
Yeah, both of them.

392
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,630
好的  再见
Okay. Okay, bye.

393
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,240
他是常客吗
Is he a regular?

394
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,490
不是
No.

395
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,140
你来买  我来卖
You're buying, I'm selling.

396
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,530
那好吧
All right, then.

397
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,940
就请你看一眼
All I'm asking is that you take a look.

398
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,270
对不起  伙计  没有冒犯你的意思
I'm sorry, buddy -- no offense.

399
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,800
我真的不感兴趣
I'm just -- you know, I'm not interested.

400
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,910
得了吧  伙计
Come on, man.

401
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,250
看一眼又不会怎么样
What's it gonna hurt to take a look?

402
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,740
只占用你两秒钟
It'll take you two seconds.

403
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,660
好吧
All right.

404
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,490
好吧  给我看看
All right. Show me what you got.

405
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,660
瞧
Boom.

406
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,420
好吧
Okay.

407
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,100
你看到了吗
Do you see it?

408
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,580
我看到一枚肯尼迪五十美分币
I see a Kennedy half-dollar.

409
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
他面朝哪里
Which way is he facing?

410
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,110
他面朝左
JFK's facing left.

411
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,600
正确
Exactly.

412
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,310
那么他应该面朝哪个方向呢
Hey, which way is he supposed to be facing?

413
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,960
右  他应该面朝右的
Right -- he's supposed to be facing right.

414
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,660
好吧  那么为什么这枚币上是朝左呢
Okay, so why -- why is this one facing left?

415
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,060
1963年11月22日
November 22, 1963 --

416
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,090
肯尼迪遇刺  对吧
Kennedy is assassinated, right?

417
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,730
举国哀恸
The whole nation goes into mourning.

418
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,250
人们开始把看到的每件东西都以他命名
They start naming everything in sight after him.

419
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,130
造币厂也想掺一脚
And the mint wants in on the act.

420
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,440
因此在六四年
So, in '64,

421
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,400
他们决定把林肯五十美分币
they decide to change the Lincoln half-dollar

422
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,730
改成肯尼迪五十美分币
into the Kennedy half-dollar.

423
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,780
当初设计时  肯尼迪是面朝右的
When they design it, they put Kennedy facing right,

424
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,560
即面朝东  和林肯的朝向一样
facing east, just the way they had Lincoln.

425
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,670
你知道为什么吗
You know why?

426
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,840
东方象征着黎明
East symbolizes the dawn.

427
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,950
这也是为什么每座坟墓也是面朝东的  懂吗
It's why pretty much every grave everywhere faces east, you know?

428
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,620
好让逝者的灵魂面朝初升的太阳
So the spirit of the dead person faces the rising sun.

429
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,790
这是丧葬习俗
You know, it's a death thing. It's a burial thing.

430
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,310
然而丹佛造币厂有个技术人员
But there's one technician in the Denver Mint, right?

431
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,680
这个人  他相信肯尼迪政府的新疆界政策
And this guy -- he believed in, uh, the New Frontier --

432
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,180
光辉岁月  这些施政理念
Camelot, the whole deal.

433
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,180
{\an8}肯尼迪任美国总统时华盛顿的繁荣景象

434
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,630
因此肯尼迪遇刺对他是个毁灭性打击
So, the assassination just destroyed him.

435
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,180
当他看到币上肯尼迪面朝东方
When he sees that coin with Kennedy facing east,

436
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,490
面朝美国的过去时  他被激怒了
facing the American past, pissed him off.

437
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,210
所以他特立独行
And so he went rogue.

438
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,710
在没有告诉任何人的情况下
Without telling anybody,

439
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,510
他把设计翻了个面
he flipped things around

440
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,130
好让肯尼迪面朝西方
so that Kennedy was facing west,

441
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,330
朝向新疆界  朝向未来
towards the new frontier, the future.

442
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,890
铸造了大约三千枚这样的错币之后
Now, the mint struck about 3,000 of these

443
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,990
造币厂才发现其中端倪
before they figured it out.

444
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,280
这名技术人员被抓
They canned the guy.

445
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,570
有大约一千枚错币进入市场流通
About 1,000 of them made it out into general circulation.

446
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,190
后来大部分被追回
They managed to get most of them back,

447
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,730
然后被熔毁  不过...
melt them down, but...

448
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,570
还是有...
there are still...

449
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,070
大概两百多枚在外流通
...200-plus floating around out there.

450
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,370
你说啥  我没听清
What's that? I didn't catch that.

451
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,260
我什么也没说
I didn't say anything.

452
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,820
你不介意吧  伙计
Do you mind, buddy?

453
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,890
我们正在聊些私事儿
We're having a private conversation here.

454
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,180
这枚品相不算最好
This one's not in perfect condition,

455
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,660
但市面上的价格
but on the open market,

456
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,790
我想它还是会值...  六到八百块
I'd say it's worth... 600 or 800 bucks.

457
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,390
八百块
$800?

458
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,050
是的  不过我实在手头紧
Yeah, but I'm hard up,

459
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,580
所以一百块便宜出了
So I'll take, uh, $100 for it.

460
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,330
你想让我出一百块买你的五十分硬币
You want me to give you $100 for a half-dollar.

461
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,540
我想让你出一百块  买价值八百块的硬币
I want you to give me $100 for an $800 coin.

462
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,150
算了吧  哥们
Yeah, I don't know, man. You know?

463
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,140
我先去方便一下  你再想想
I'm gonna go drain the snake. Think about it.

464
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,640
那货在耍我  对吧
This guy's playing me, right?

465
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,900
当然了
Definitely.

466
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,630
真是个王八蛋
Slick son of a bitch.

467
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,800
我看  我就应该...
You know, I should...

468
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,740
告诉你  我在沃巴什认识一个人
You know what? I know this guy on Wabash --

469
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,140
是个钱币商  我叔叔的朋友
Coin dealer, a friend of my uncle's.

470
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,720
乔伊  用用你的电话行吗
Hey, Joey, can I use your phone?

471
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,370
-就打给本地人  -别打太久
- Local call. - Keep it short.

472
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,490
好
Right on.

473
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,860
我找找号码
Let's see. Man.

474
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,260
我给他打个电话  如果他说这是个骗局
I'm gonna call this guy, and when he tells me this is a scam,

475
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,700
你知道我要干嘛吗  我要报警
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna call the cops

476
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,450
让那混蛋进局子
and get this scumbag thrown in the can.

477
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,090
你就是我的证人  行吗
You're my witness, okay?

478
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,050
还面朝西
Facing west.

479
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,170
放狗屁
My hairy ass.

480
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,600
你好啊
Hey. How you doing?

481
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,170
我是阿尔文  戴夫·坦纳的侄子
Yeah, it's Alvin, Dave Tanner's nephew.

482
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,220

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,110
没错
Yeah, that's right.

484
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,180
我要和你说件事  可不是开玩笑
Hey, this is gonna sound like the beginning of a bad joke,

485
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,600
我在酒吧里碰见个人
but, uh, I'm in this bar, and I've got this guy

486
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,170
满嘴跑火车
spinning this cock-and-bull story

487
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,860
想卖给我个五十分硬币
about this, uh, 50-cent piece he's trying to sell me.

488
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,320
他说什么肯尼迪的脸
He says, uh -- says Kennedy's supposed to be

489
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,250
本应该是朝西的
facing west or something.

490
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,820
没错
Yeah

491
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,490
这样啊
Yeah?

492
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,550

Yeah. That's what he said -- Denver.

495
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,250

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,470

谢谢  乔伊
Thanks, Joey.

500
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,690
他怎么说的
So, what did he say?

501
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,150
这个嘛  他说  他也不太清楚
Yeah, you know, he -- he didn't really know much.

502
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,740
这样  给你五十块  我买你的硬币
I'll tell you what -- I'll give you $50 for it.

503
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,360
才五十  卖一百块我都不赚
$50? I'm taking a bath at $100.

504
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,850
好吧
A-all right. Okay.

505
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,930
你看  我这有六十四块
Look, I got... $64 right here.

506
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,790
这可是价值八百块的硬币
It's an $800 coin, okay?

507
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,790
怎么能六十四块就卖给你
I'm not gonna sell it to you for $64.

508
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,040
这样  你等着我  我马上拿一百块来
Okay, if you wait for me, I'll get you 100 bucks.

509
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,540
-也行吧  -好吧
- I don't know. - Okay.

510
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,870
哥们  我这儿有七十五块
Hey, buddy, I got 75 bucks right here.

511
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,920
对不起  一百块我才卖
I-I -- sorry. I need $100.

512
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,550
没人和你说话
Hey, slick, nobody's talking to you.

513
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,820
管好你自己的事就行了
Mind your own business, okay, come on?

514
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,820
那八十块现金呢
Cash money, $80.

515
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,990
你要是等等我  我等下给你一百一
Look, if you give me a chance, I'll be back with $110.

516
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,640
等多久
How long will that be?

517
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,310
我不知道  我得先去赶火车  再回来
I don't know. I got to catch a train, come back --

518
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,420
-一小时  最多一个半小时  -你知道吗
- Hour, hour and a half at the most. - Yeah, you know, this guy

519
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,990
-这人刚才还说要报警抓你  -我没说
- was getting ready to call the cops on you. - No, I was not.

520
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,660
什么  你怎么这样
What? Why would you do that?

521
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,080
这都是他胡编乱造的
That -- that -- now this guy is making shit up!

522
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,530
我这儿有一百一
Hey, I got $110 right here.

523
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,780
-就卖给你了  -不行不行
- Sold. - No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

524
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,370
人家给的可是现金
This guy's got the cash. Now...

525
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,720
-你不能这样  -拿好
- Don't do that. - Here, take care of that.

526
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,770
这可是有历史价值的
That's history right there.

527
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,250
-你怎么能这样  -怪你自己没钱吧
- Hey, you can't do that. - Hey, money talks.

528
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,470
游戏结束  你输了
You lost. It's over.

529
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,720
什么结束  你放什么狗屁
No, it's not over. No, that's crap.

530
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,840
你要去哪你
And where do you think you're going, huh?

531
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,930
哥们  别碰我
Hey, back off, dude.

532
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,780
你把硬币给我  我就放你走
Yeah, I'll back off when you give me the JFK back.

533
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,760
乔伊  快报警
Hey, Joey, call the cops.

534
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,150
这人抢了我的钱
This guy just tried to rip me off.

535
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,520
他才是骗子  我谁也没骗
Hey, this guy's a liar. I did not rip anybody off.

536
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,390
你怎么没骗
Yes, you did!

537
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,540
你敢回来  看我揍不死你
You come back in here, and your ass is grass!

538
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,050
我上头有人
I got friends, buddy!

539
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,100
记住了吗  你个死骗子
Do you hear me?! You double-dealing bastard!

540
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,790
我朋友一抓一大把
I got friends!

541
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,630
你真棒
You are so beautiful!

542
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,750
大家听着  下一杯酒我们请
Hey, everybody, next round's on us!

543
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,930
好  你在听我说吗
All right. Are you listening?

544
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,850
能保密吗
Can you keep a secret?

545
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,790
当然了  没问题
Yeah. Absolutely.

546
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,140
那人叫伊迪·阿巴西
Okay, his name is Idi Abbassi.

547
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,610
二十七岁
He's 27 years old.

548
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,570
是尼日利亚王子
He's a Nigerian prince, all right?

549
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,850
他的身价  少说也有四亿美元
He's worth, conservatively, $400 million.

550
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,920
{\an8}出自于博尔赫斯的小说
《特隆  乌克巴尔  奥比斯·特蒂乌斯》

551
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,920
赤道乌克巴尔奥比斯国的独裁政权
The dictatorship of Equatorial Uqbar Orbis

552
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,970
诬告他  并将他扣押
is detaining him on trumped-up charges.

553
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,100
阿巴西的家人快急疯了
Now, the Abbassi family -- they're going crazy.

554
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,900
任何帮他们把儿子救出来的人  都能受重赏
They will reward whoever helps them get their boy back.

555
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,440
但问题是  银行冻结了他们的资产
The hitch is, the banks have frozen their......assets

556
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,250
我说的是爱尔兰的赛马马票
I'm talking Irish sweeps tickets,

557
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,270
满满一车都是
a whole trunk full of 'em.

558
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,420
就在芝加哥奥黑尔机场  被海关扣押
They're just sitting at O'Hare, impounded in customs.

559
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,890
我知道你想说"那又怎样"
Now, I know what you're saying, "So what?"

560
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,270
我本可以用它作抵押  但你要知道
I can leave this as security, but you got to understand --

561
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,310
这把小提琴就是我的命根  是价值连城的古董
this violin is my livelihood. It's a valuable antique.

562
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,880
为什么说它不是你的
What do you mean it doesn't belong to you?

563
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,660
我出九百块买你这个  现金支付
I'll pay you 900 bucks for this -- cash on the barrel.

564
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,610
我不想卖  我可不想离开我的琴
I don't know. I hate to part with it.

565
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,820
它在我家已经很多年了
It's been in my family for years.

566
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,160
你会保密的  对吧
You can keep a secret, right?

567
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,040
当然了
Yeah, absolutely.

568
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,540
不过关键是得有个好名头
But the point is, you need a good front,

569
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,990
这样才能获得最大收益
so you're gonna have the most return on your dollars.

570
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,610
但我知道一个海关人员...
But I know this customs officer...

571
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,260
那些钱  做个很好的投资
...that money, then make it an investment.

572
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,990
如果价格合理
...if the price is right.

573
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,480
我只关心投资  只关心收益
And I'm all about investments, all about what's coming next.

574
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,520
小子  帮我把我老婆的车
Hey, kid, help me get my wife's car

575
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,090
从那治安混乱的街区里开出来
out of this bad neighborhood.

576
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,690
先生  先生  能帮我个忙吗
Sir, sir, could you help me?

577
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,610
告诉我  这些是今天的数字吗
Tell me -- are these today's numbers?

578
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,670
没有一个是完全合法的
Now, none of this was strictly legal,

579
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,110
-进口税高得吓人...  -试试吧
- and the import taxes would have been a killer... - have at it.

580
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,580
所以他必须想办法让钱神不知鬼不觉地
...so he had to find a way to get the money into the country

581
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,070
流入国内
without anyone knowing about it.

582
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,310
他在钞票上涂了一层黑色的东西...
He coated the cash with this black stuff --

583
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,430
威克创胶
Vectrol paste.

584
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,280
只有用一种特殊的化学药品才能将其除掉
And the only way to get it off is with a special chemical.

585
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,010
虽然价格不菲  但利润呢
It's not cheap, but the upside?

586
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,990
利润相当可观
The upside is huge.

587
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,460
你能替我保守秘密吗
Can you keep a secret?

588
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,270
就是《与狼共舞》里的那个人
You know, the guy in "Dances with Wolves"?

589
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,770
一个像你这样的人  有钱
A guy like you, who's got some money,

590
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,680
有钱拿来挥霍...
who's got some money to throw around...

591
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,800
我知道你想说"谁在乎呢"
Now, I know what you're saying -- "Who cares?"

592
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,940

叫救护车
I need an ambulance.

744
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,630
我朋友犯心脏病了
My friend's having a heart attack.

745
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,860
在一条巷子里
We're in an alley,

746
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,060
拉塞尔和薛莫街的东南边
Uh, Southeast of LaSalle and Shermer.

747
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,460
我不知道
No, I-I don't know.

748
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,160
我找到他时就这样了
He was like this when I found him.

749
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,860
别挂
Hey, hold --

750
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,570
马可  马可  能听到吗

751
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,440
-能听到吗  -我搞砸了

不  你很棒  兄弟

753
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,490
坚持住  行吗  他们在路上了
Just hold on, all right? They're on their way.

754
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,720
马上就过来
They'll be here in a minute.

755
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,870
吉米  你知道吗
Jimmy, you know what?

756
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,130
别说话  省口气吧
Just s-save your breath, okay?

757
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,170
你会没事的
You're gonna be fine.

758
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,500
这是我人生最快乐的一周
This was the greatest week of my life.

759
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:38,840
坚持住
Hang in there!

760
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,670

有人吗
Anybody!

764
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,530
马可
Marco!

765
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:09,870
吉米
Hey, jimmy.

766
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,030
兄弟
Oh, hey, bud.

767
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,960
能给根烟吗
Can I bum one?

768
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,810
这是他的吗
Is that his?

769
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,820
没错  他妈给我的
Yeah. His mom gave it to me.

770
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,570
就说很眼熟
Thought it looked familiar.

771
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,020
觉得今天该戴着
I figured I'd wear it today,

772
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,920
但不太确定
but I don't know.

773
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,710
我不喜欢大戒指  所以...
I'm not a big ring guy, so...

774
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,610
还能值几个钱呢
Still. Could be worth a couple of bucks.

775
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,430
得进去了
Better head back.

776
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,730
里头见
See you inside.

777
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,280
是弗瑞斯·巴勒吗
Is this Ferris Bueller?

778
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,280
{\an8}《春天不是读书天》中的主角逃学生

779
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,640
你说
Speaking.

780
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,860
没想打扰你的假期
I don't want to interrupt your big day off.

781
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,500
我就问问  准备干嘛呀
Just checking in. What are you up to?

782
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,560
把这地方烧了
You know, burning down the place.

783
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,750
就知道你会这样
I wouldn't expect any less.

784
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,480
不管怎样  你现在还生气吗
So, whatever it was, did you get it out of your system?

785
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,730
不生气了
Yep, all gone.

786
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,670
很好  我想告诉你一些进展
Good. I want to run something by you.

787
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,190
矶鹞渡一案  哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所接不下
The Sandpiper case -- it's getting too big for HHM.

788
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,310
霍华德决定和另一家公司合作
Howard's decided to partner with another firm.

789
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,600
戴维斯梅因律所  你听说过他们吗
Davis and Main. You heard of them?

790
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,760
-当然  在圣达菲  -没错
- Sure, up in Santa Fe. - Right.

791
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,110
他们也听说过你  并且很感兴趣
Well, they've heard of you, too, and they're interested.

792
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,300
他们想给你个面试机会
They want to make you an offer contingent on an interview.

793
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,980
他们考虑给你合伙人机会
They've got a partner-track position in mind.

794
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,460
等下  什么
Wait. What?

795
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,360
合伙人机会  你是什么意思
Partner track? What are you talking about?

796
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,560
我是说在圣达菲有一间
I'm talking about there's an office in Santa Fe

797
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,260
写有你名字的办公室  或是可能有
with your name on it, or there could be,

798
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,720
你可以接自己的案子
and you'd be working on your case.

799
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,260
我
I -- well, I --

800
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,220
我不...
I don't even, uh...

801
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,710
查克不会同意的
Chuck wouldn't like it.

802
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,120
查克管不着
Chuck has no say in this.

803
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,710
你不是为他工作
You wouldn't be working for HHM,

804
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,690
查克不能左右戴维斯梅因律所
and Chuck can't tell Davis and Main who to hire.

805
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,460
为什么是我
Why me?

806
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,200
这是为了扣税还是搞慈善啊
Is this like a tax write-off or a charity thing?

807
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,990
目的是什么
What's the angle, huh?

808
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,820
吉米  我们一直在跟你的委托人联系
Jimmy, we've been talking to your clients,

809
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,020
矶鹞渡的那些老人
the Sandpiper residents,

810
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,290
他们一有机会就会问到你
and they ask about you every chance they get.

811
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,110
我不知道怎么回事  但他们很喜欢你
I don't know what it is, but you have a way with them.

812
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,250
老人都爱我
Old people love me.

813
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,330
那就这么说定了
So...sounds good?

814
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,750
金  我无法想象你为此做了多少努力
Kim, I can't imagine what you did to make this happen.

815
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

816
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,300
我也没做  太多
I didn't do anything... much.

817
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,730
不管你信不信  霍华德也为此做出了努力
And believe it or not, Howard's been pushing this, too.

818
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,730
老好人霍华德啊
Good, old Howard.

819
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,110
听着  周四上午十一点
Listen, we're gonna be down in Judge Murray's court

820
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,920
我们会在默里法官的法庭
on Thursday at 11:00.

821
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,950
戴维斯梅因律所的人也会在那儿
The Davis and Main people will be there.

822
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,940
那时候见他们再好不过了
It'd be the perfect chance for you to meet them.

823
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,040
周四上午十一点  好的  我准时到
Thursday at 11:00. All right, I'll be there.

824
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,850
真的谢谢你  金
Thanks, Kim, really.

825
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:20,910
到时见
I'll see you then.

826
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,910
所有原件都需复印并归档
All the originals need to be copied and filed.

827
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,550
我在盒子上写了  "复印和归档"
See, I've written right here on the box -- "Copy and file."

828
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,310
就是为了表达清楚
That's to make it as clear as possible.

829
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,350
明白了  麦吉尔先生  还有什么需要吗
Got it, Mr. McGill. Anything else?

830
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,530
关于食品方面
Well, on the grocery front,

831
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,610
这次几乎都买对了
almost everything was right this time.

832
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,230
-太好了  -"几乎"
- Great. - Almost.

833
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,440
只是件小事  但按我的口味
Um, it's a small thing, but to my taste,

834
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,230
澳洲青苹果有点儿太酸了
the, uh, Granny Smith apples are a bit too tart.

835
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,180
-你说的是那些绿色的对吗  -是的
- Those are the green ones, right? - Right.

836
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,870
我喜欢红色的那些  但不是红蛇果
I prefer the red ones, but not Red Delicious.

837
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,660
那些基本上没什么味道
Those are generally tasteless.

838
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,510
富士苹果应该上市了
Fujis should be in season.

839
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,830
这不是什么大事  但是
It's not a major issue, but...

840
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,650
明白了  富士苹果
Yeah. Fuji apples.

841
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,620
没问题
Okay.

842
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,250
我还想喝豆奶
Oh, and I'd like to try soy milk,

843
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,790
所以可以买半加仑
so maybe a half gallon of that.

844
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:09,730
没问题
You got it.

845
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,200
谢谢  欧内斯托
Well, thank you, Ernesto.

846
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,810
非常感谢你能注意细节
I appreciate your attention to detail.

847
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,810
你不需要把这些都写下来吗
Do you need to write any of this down?

848
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:20,920
写下来更好
'Cause it's okay if you do.

849
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,300
到时记得住
You know, just to be sure.

850
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,930
富士苹果
So, Fuji apples.

851
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,620
你好  欧尼
Hey, Ernie.

852
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,990
最近怎么样  伙计
How you doing, man?

853
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,190
还不错
Good, good.

854
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,710
霍华德让你来照顾查克啊
So, Howard's got you looking after Chuck, huh?

855
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,790
是啊  能多挣些
Yeah. It's a few extra bucks, you know?

856
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,950
他怎么样
How's he doing?

857
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,190
还可以  老样子
Seems okay, like usual.

858
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,150
本来咱可以去喝一杯的
I'd say we could grab a beer,

859
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,500
但他们等着我把文件带回公司
but they're waiting on all that paperwork back at the office --

860
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,410
你懂的
You know how it is.

861
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:04,770
可不是么
Don't I, though?

862
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,140
回头见  吉米
See you, Jimmy.

863
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,300
回头见  欧尼
Uh, see you 'round, Ernie.

864
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,470
你以前跟他打过交道吗
You done business with him before?

865
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,690
好的
Right.

866
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,210
我会去的
Yeah. I'll be there.

867
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,380
戴维斯梅因  麦吉尔
Davis and Main and McGill.

868
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,440
很高兴见到你们
Great to meet you.

869
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,940
很高兴见到你们  先生们
Nice to meet you, gentlemen.

870
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,900
见到你们真是太好了
It's good to meet you.

871
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,620
好
Nice...

872
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,360
挺快啊
Well, that was quick.

873
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,050
-不收费  -帮我想想
- No charge. - Help me out here.

874
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,550
我是在做梦  还是我办公桌上真的有
Did I dream it, or did I have $1,600,000

875
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:14,810
一百六十万美元现金
on my desk in cash?

876
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,360
闭上眼睛之后我还是能看到
When I close my eyes, I can still see it.

877
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,250
就好像我一直看着太阳
It's burned into my retinas

878
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,850
灼烧着我的视网膜
like I was staring into the sun.

879
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:23,350
地球上没人知道我们有这钱
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.

880
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,090
我们可以五五分成
We could have split it 50/50.

881
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:30,380
我们本可以每人带八十万美金回家  不用交税
We could have gone home with $800,000 each, tax-free.

882
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:32,730
你想说什么
Your point being?

883
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:36,390
我们为什么没那么干  什么阻止了我们
Why didn't we? What stopped us?

884
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,990
我记得你说  要做对的事
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.

885
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,070
我都不知道那是什么意思
I don't even know what that means.

886
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,830
你想知道我为什么没拿那钱吗
You want to know why I didn't take that money?

887
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,410
你是在问这个吗
Is that what you're asking?

888
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,790
没错  我是想问那个问题
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

889
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,950
对我个人来说  别人雇我干活
Me, personally -- I was hired to do a job.

890
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,160
我干完了  就结束了
I did it. That's as far as it goes.

891
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,340
是啊  我知道是什么阻止了我
Yeah. Well, I know what stopped me.

892
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,220
听好了  它再也不会阻止我了
And you know what? It's never stopping me again.
