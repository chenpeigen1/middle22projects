23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,760
{\an8}辛那邦

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:41,210
{\an8}这一口  从未如此美味

25
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,380
这细节真不错
Yeah, that is some detail.

26
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,060
真是具有西部风情的细节
That is some western detail right there --

27
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,010
看看这西部风情的细节
Western detail, attention to detail.

28
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,550
看啊  他靴子背后竟然还有马刺
Look, he's even got the spurs on the back of his boots.

29
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,150
-还很锋利  -我喜欢
- And they are sharp. - I love it.

30
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,990
真的很锋利
They are.

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,650
介绍这件已经超时了  克里斯汀...
Well, the clock is gone on this piece, Christine, so...

32
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,870
天啊  那我们继续下一件
Oh, my goodness! Well, let's just move on.

33
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,960
人嘛  有时候是会犯错误  没事的
Well, from time to time, people make mistakes -- that's okay.

34
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,610
这是今晚第一件雷诺阿[法国画家]作品
This is our first Renoir of the evening.

35
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,350
是一件凹版作品  就是一种蚀刻画
This is a heliogravure, which is an etching.

36
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,390
1919年于巴黎  用一块铜板手工打造
It was hand-pulled from a copper plate in Paris in 1919.

37
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,970
我们之所以知道  是因为这背后的
We know this because that's what it says on the back,

38
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,300
防伪证书上面有写
where the certificate of authenticity is located.

39
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,500
真是高雅到了极致
Just as lovely as can be.

40
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,680
看看这柔和细腻的色差  极富阴柔之美
Look at the soft, delicate shading -- very feminine.

41
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,690
这可是限量版
This is a limited edition.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,530
如果你钟爱雷诺阿的作品  千万不要错过
This is what you're looking for if you are a Renoir fan.

43
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,970
天啊  时间刚好
100 -- oh, my goodness. Right at the buzzer.

44
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,860
不错
Good.

45
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,160
非洲饼干陆龟是个例外
...of the few exceptions is the African pancake tortoise,

46
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,120
它有扁平且灵活的壳
which has a flat, flexible shell

47
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,570
可以让它藏匿于岩石裂缝中
that allows it to hide in rock crevasses.

48
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,060
一场大规模小到中雪
Big swath of light to moderate snow

49
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,000
从布罗肯鲍地区南下科尔尼  海斯廷斯
from the Broken Bow area down toward Kearney, Hastings,

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,760
格兰德岛  正朝我们这里前进
Grand Island -- that is all moving in our direction.

51
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,990
所以我认为  七点到八点左右
So I do think, around 7:00 to 8:00,

52
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,280
整个地区会开始持续降雪
the snow will become pretty steady here across the region

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,280
随着降雪向我们逼近
with all this moving on top of us,

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,350
能见度也会下降不少
and that's really gonna knock down visibilities.

55
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:08,900
当然
And, again,

56
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,530
今晚的道路很有可能会积雪
snow-covered roads are gonna be definitely likely this evening,

57
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,700
会变得更滑  比...
making it even slippier -- or more...

58
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,190
比现在外面的道路更滑
...more slippery than it is out there at this time.

59
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,520
有关部门已发布冬季天气预警
There's that winter-weather advisory in effect

60
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,200
直至明早
until very early tomorrow morning.

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,730
我们再来看降雪总量
We're gonna talk snowfall totals.

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,310
寒冷天气
Will bitter, cold weather

63
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,020
是否有助于解决今秋田地里
help break up the compaction issues

64
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,910
出现的土壤压实问题呢
we created this fall in our fields?

65
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,170
在今天的《钢铁对话》[一档农业节目]中
Well, we'll show you where it will and

66
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,630
我们将告诉你这一情况
where it won't during today's Iron Talk.

67
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,860
说起土壤压实
When it comes to compaction...

68
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,910
有两种不同类型的土壤压实
...there's really two different types of compaction.

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,480
一是垂直压实
There's vertical compaction,

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,130
二是水平压实
and there's horizontal compaction.

71
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,790
两者有很大差异
And there's a big difference.

72
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,170
如果是水平压实
With horizontal compaction,

73
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,960
冻融是没有什么用处的
there really isn't much hope for help from a freeze thaw.

74
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,980
因为坚硬紧实的地层膨胀
And the reason why, as that hard, compacted layer swells

75
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,140
在春天解冻后会重回原位
and then, in the spring, thaws back out and settles back down,

76
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,330
其实根本没有打破压实层
there's really no breaking up of the compaction.

77
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,530
而垂直空间上  压实层向外膨胀
With a vertical zone, when compaction swells out,

78
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,510
到春天就会破裂
and then it breaks up in the spring,

79
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,620
这样一来问题就好办了
then you can actually get a little bit of help.

80
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,880
如果在过度潮湿的情况下耕作
So if you have some horizontal compaction created by

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,050
导致出现了水平压实...
doing some tillage when it was a little too wet, or...

82
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,880
不要让虚假指控害你陷入不公平的公司
Don't let false allegations bully you into an unfair fight.

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,520
你好  我是索尔·古德曼  我会为你而战
Hi, I'm Saul Goodman, and I will do the fighting for you.

84
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,340
我能搞定任何指控
No charge is too big for me.

85
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,990
面临法律效力走投无路时  不如打给索尔
When legal forces have you cornered, better call Saul!

86
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,120
我会让你的案子撤销
I'll get your case dismissed.

87
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,250
我会给你应得的辩护  为什么
I'll give you the defense you deserve. Why?

88
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,940
因为我是律师索尔·古德曼
Because I'm Saul Goodman, attorney-at-law.

89
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,330
我既会调查  又会辩护  还会说服别人
I investigate, advocate, persuade,

90
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,050
最重要的是  我会打赢官司
and, most importantly, win! Win...win...win!

91
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,820
不如打给索尔
Better call Saul.

92
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,380
你是否感到绝望
Do you feel doomed?

93
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,100
是否遭受敌人威胁  自由难保
Have opponents of freedom wrongly intimidated you?

94
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
或许他们告诉你  你惹了大麻烦
Maybe they told you that you're in serious trouble

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,880
你束手无策  不知所措
and there's nothing you can do about it.

96
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,050
我是索尔·古德曼
I'm Saul Goodman,

97
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,080
让我来告诉你  他们错了
and I'm here to tell you that they're wrong.

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,090
争取正义  为时不晚  不如打给...
It's never too late for justice. Better call...

{\an8}新墨西哥州第二司法管辖区
公平

101
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,710
回想一下...  你的大脑...
Think back... your brain...

102
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,750
已经记不太清了
I-it's just not all there yet.

103
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,270
如果我们都要为19岁时做的事负责
If we were all held responsible for what we did when we were 19...

104
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,790
我还记得小时候的感觉  回想一下
I remember what it was like to be a kid. Think back.

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,520
告诉他们  法官大人  你怎么想
Tell 'em, judge, what would you say?

106
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,310
这些男孩儿  19岁
These boys -- 19.

107
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,040
我不能...  我不...
I can't -- I don't --

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,370
这三个年轻小伙儿
these three young men...

109
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,170
就像曾经的你们
Just like you.

110
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,120
就像曾经的你们
Just like you.

111
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,580
女士们先生们  想象一下重返19岁的感觉
Oh, to be 19 again, you with me, ladies and gentlemen?

112
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,780
还记得你们的19岁吗
Do you remember 19?

113
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,790
十九岁时风华正茂
Let me tell you, the juices are flowing.

114
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,620
血气方刚  精力旺盛
The red corpuscles are corpuscling,

115
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,270
草地又绿又软
the grass is green, and it's soft,

116
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,400
夏日永不结束
and summer's gonna last forever.

117
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,340
你们还记得吗
Now, do you remember?

118
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,620
当然记得
Yeah, you do.

119
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,260
但说真的  扪心自问
But if you're being honest, I mean, well, really honest,

120
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,110
你们会想起来  那时的自己
you'll recall that you also had

121
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,770
还有一颗发育不全的19岁大脑
an underdeveloped 19-year-old brain.

122
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,160
就我个人来说  如果我要为
Me, personally, I-it, if I were held accountable

123
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,540
19岁时做出的蠢事负责
for some of the stupid decisions I made

124
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,610
我的天
when I was 19, oh, boy, wow.

125
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,150
我们现在要是在教堂
And I bet if we were in church right now,

126
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,310
你们都会向我说"阿门"[表示赞同]
I'd get a big "Amen!"

127
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,740
所以说回到本案主角
Which brings us to these three--

128
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,820
也就是这三个蠢货
now, these three knuckleheads,

129
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,190
很抱歉  但你们的确是蠢货
and I'm sorry, boys, but that's what you are--

130
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,740
他们做了件蠢事  这点无可否认
they did a dumb thing. We're not denying that.

131
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,070
不过  我想请各位记住两点重要事实
However, I would like you to remember two salient facts.

132
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,700
第一  没有人受伤  完全没有
Fact one, nobody got hurt, not a soul.

133
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,170
这点非常重要
Very important to keep that in mind.

134
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,880
第二  控方一直
Fact two, now, the prosecution

135
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,030
揪着"非法闯入"这个词不放
keeps bandying this term "Criminal trespass."

136
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,570
斯宾诺佐先生  也就是房子的主人
Mr. Spinowzo, the property owner,

137
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,960
向我们承认  他大部分的店铺
admitted to us that he keeps most portions of his business

138
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,670
日夜向公众开放
open to the public both day and night.

139
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,480
闯入
So, trespassing?

140
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,260
这个词有点过了  不是吗  戴夫
That's a bit of a reach, don't you think, Dave?

141
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,840
据我所知
Here's what I know--

142
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,720
这三位年轻人  几乎都是荣誉学生
these three young men, near honors students all,

143
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,220
周六晚有点兴奋
were feeling their oats one Saturday night,

144
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,360
脑袋不清楚  干了些傻事
and they just... went a little bananas.

145
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,060
我也说不清
I don't know.

146
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,410
你们可以当我疯了  但我认为
Call me crazy, but I don't think they deserve

147
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,690
他们的大好前程
to have their bright futures ruined

148
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,820
不应被一时迷失心智
by a momentary, minute,

149
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,400
永不会再犯的小错毁掉
never-to-be-repeated lapse of judgment.

150
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,690
各位  所谓大人不记小人过
Ladies and gentlemen, you're bigger than that.

151
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,260
-肯尼  你在录吗  -在录  等一下
- Kenny, Kenny, are you rolling? - Yeah, yeah. Wait a minute.

152
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,390
老兄  小声点  别这么激动
But, dude, but, dude, pipe down. Chill out, would you?

153
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,610
沃特森老师第四节生物课的同学们
Hey, Mrs. Watson's fourth-period biology class,

154
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,100
这个是专门为你准备的  好好学着吧
this one's for you. Watch and learn, losers.

155
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,250
-天呐  -怎么都没有血
- Oh, God! - Dude! Where did all the blood go?!

156
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,530
他都死了  血早就抽干了
Dude, he's dead. they suck it all out, dumbass.

157
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,570
真棒  他们把血放到哪去了
Awesome. Where do they put it?

158
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,530
我现在切到颈骨了
All right, I'm though the neck bone now, dude.

159
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,220
-真棒  -肯尼  到这来
- Oh, nice. - Kenny, get over here, man.

160
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,430
我弄好了  把它拿走
I'm-I'm getting it. Get this out of here.

161
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,740
好吧
All right. All right, fine.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,740
让我来
Here, let me do it.

163
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,300
-我能行  -好吧
- I got it! - All right.

164
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,730
-拿着  -天呐
- Get that. All right. - Oh, my God.

165
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,120
让我来
Here, let me do it.

166
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,030
走开
Dude, get off!

167
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,300
别激动
Chill out.

168
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,520
好吧  等等
All right. Wait, wait.

169
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,470
等等
Okay, wait for it. Wait.

170
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,850
-终于弄下来了  -这位老兄真是
- Come on! Yeah, baby, yeah! - This dude was-

171
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,840
我猜你肯定会把小弟弟放进他喉咙里
Dude, I dare you to stick your wang in the throat hole.

172
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,640
你放我就放
I will if you will, loser.

173
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,150
好吧
All right, all right!

174
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,650
{\an1}{\pos(23,225)}七百美金
收款人 詹姆斯·麦吉尔

175
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,680
你不会算数吗
What the hell kind of math is that?

176
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,160
一场辩护700美金
$700 per defense.

177
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,760
不是辩护  是"委托人" "人"
No, no, no. "Defendant." "...dant."

178
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,750
三个人一共2100  真是便宜
Three defendants, $2,100, which, by the way, bargain--

179
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,110
我可是据理力争
what I did for them.

180
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,960
可人家还是要去蹲监狱啊
They going to jail, ain't they?

181
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,460
这跟钱有什么关系
So, since when does that matter?!

182
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,530
他们操了一颗死人头
They had sex with a head!

183
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,250
没人让你一次代理三个人
Look, didn't nobody tell you to try all three of them together.

184
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,430
一次庭审只有700美金
One trial, $700.

185
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,260
你会想我的  你肯定会想我
You're gonna miss me. You are gonna miss me.

186
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,630
我告诉你  就算天下红雨
Cause it'll be a cold day in hell

187
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,290
我也不会再为这个傻逼法庭做公设律师
before I do any more P.D. work for this shitty court!

188
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,760
再见  宝贝
Sayonara, baby!

189
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,190
祝你过得愉快
You have yourself a nice day.

190
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,290
詹姆斯·麦吉尔法律办公室
Law offices of James McGill.

191
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,860
请问找哪位
How may I direct your call?

192
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,060
凯特尔曼夫人  很高兴您能再次来电
Yes, Mrs. Kettleman, so good of you to return.

193
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,470
麦吉尔先生此时不在办公室
A-actually, I don't have Mr. McGill at the moment,

194
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,520
但是他...
but I know he'd--

195
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,300
棒极了
Oh, splendid.

196
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,160
很抱歉  我们的办公室正在刷漆
Unfortunately, our offices are being painted

197
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,640
到处都乌烟瘴气的
and the fumes are quite horrid.

198
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,490
他能否与您和您的丈夫
Could he meet you and your husband at, say,

199
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,870
在中心路的洛约拉咖啡店见面
Uh, Loyola's cafe on central?

200
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,390
那就约四点  再见
4:00 it shall be. Cheers.

201
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,300
三块
$3.

202
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,240
我认证过了  看到贴纸了吗
Uh, I'm validated. See the stickers?

203
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,640
是  有五张贴纸
Well, I see five stickers.

204
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,930
少了一张  三块
You're one shy. It's $3.

205
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,670
他们给了我...  听着
They gave me -- look.

206
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,760
我今天全天都可以免费进出  好吗
I'm validated for the entire day, okay?

207
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,000
五张贴纸  六张贴纸  我才不管什么鬼贴纸
Five stickers, six stickers -- I don't know from stickers.

208
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,750
因为我在那里出庭
Because I was in that court back there

209
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,750
为了救人命  所以...
saving people's lives, so...

210
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,950
别装逼
Well, gee, that's swell.

211
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,720
谢谢你让我重建了对司法系统的信任
And thank you for restoring my faith in the judicial system.

212
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,490
但你现在要么付三块钱  要么回去
Now you either pay the $3, or you go back inside

213
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,180
再弄一张贴纸
and you get an additional sticker.

214
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,210
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

215
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,820
行  你赢了  祝贺你
Fine. You win. Hooray for you.

216
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,670
倒车
Backing up!

217
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,830
我得倒车  我得再去弄贴纸
I have to back up! I need more stickers!

218
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,530
我的贴纸不够
Don't have enough stickers!

219
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,500
谢谢  谢谢你  你人真好
Thank you! Thank you -- very nice!

220
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
他是本月最佳员工
Employee of the month over here!

221
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,760
没错
Yeah!

222
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,580
祝贺他  给他颁奖牌吧
Hooray! Give him a medal!

223
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,910
没事  别紧张  行吗
Don't do anything, guys. Just relax, all right?

224
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,870
我只是疑惑  为什么你觉得他得雇律师
Well, I'm just fuzzy as to why you think he needs a lawyer.

225
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,480
我觉得克雷格处理公事完美无瑕
I mean, Craig, the way you run your office is beyond reproach.

226
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,530
没错  完美无瑕
Yeah. Beyond reproach.

227
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,630
-没错  -我办事小心
- Yeah. - I'm a stickler, you know, for --

228
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,020
确实  钱方面他很小心
He is. He's a stickler with the money.

229
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,150
-他办事的确小心  -没错
- He's definitely a stickler. - Yeah. Yeah.

230
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,590
我肯定他没犯罪
I mean, he's certainly not guilty of some...

231
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,440
肯定没有  他遵纪守法
Is certainly not. He's innocent of any wrongdoing.

232
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,970
我非常清楚
That's abundantly clear to me.

233
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,730
其实我也不会为罪犯当代理律师
And frankly, I don't go looking for guilty people to represent.

234
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,350
没必要去趟浑水  是吧
I mean who needs that aggravation, right?

235
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,280
没错
Right.

236
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,990
我的信息都是从报纸上看来的
Look, all I know is what I read in the paper.

237
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,200
县财政局的钱
And typically, when money goes missing

238
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,410
不翼而飞  金额达到了
from the county treasury -- and the number here is,

239
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,990
160万美元...
Uh, $1.6 million...

240
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,830
-那是会计...  -会计核算差额
- Well, that's an accounting... - It's an accounting discrepancy.

241
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,530
确实是核算差额
It's a discrepancy, absolutely.

242
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,740
不过一般呢  出现核算差额
But typically, when that happens,

243
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,760
警方就会找财务主管
the police look at the treasurer.

244
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
既然主管就是...
And since that person is, uh --

245
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,280
我只是觉得你该抓住主动权
I just think a little proactivity may be in order.

246
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,520
-好吧  -我只是...
- Well... - You know, I just

247
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,410
觉得雇律师会显得很可疑
think I'd look guilty if I hired a lawyer.

248
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,000
-没错  -不
- Yeah. - No.

249
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,280
其实被捕才让别人觉得你有罪
Actually, it's getting arrested that makes people look guilty,

250
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,380
即便你是无辜的
Even the innocent ones,

251
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,400
但每天都有无辜的人被捕
and innocent people get arrested every day.

252
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,520
他们最后被关在小房间里
And they find themselves in a little room

253
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,900
警探假装是他们最好的朋友
with a detective who acts like he's their best friend.

254
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,010
"告诉我"  警探说  "帮我查清此案"
"Talk to me," He says. Uh, "Help me clear this thing up.

255
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,500
"你不用请律师  只有罪犯才需要律师"
You don't need a lawyer -- only guilty people need lawyers."

256
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,340
你就中招了
And boom!

257
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,700
一失足成千古恨
Hey, that's when it all goes south.

258
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,800
这时候你就需要一个人帮你
That's when you want someone in your corner,

259
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,770
不遗余力地帮你
someone who will fight tooth and nail.

260
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,470
律师就像健康保险
Lawyers -- you know, we're like health insurance.

261
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,670
谁都希望自己用不着
You hope you never need it.

262
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,550
但没有可不行
But, man, oh, man, not having it -- no.

263
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,000
接下来怎么办
How would we proceed

264
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,130
-如果我们决定  -行  这是一份
- if we decided to, uh... - Oh, well, this is a...

265
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,130
约定函
...letter of engagement.

266
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,750
非常简洁明了
It's very simple, straightforward.

267
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,710
请仔细阅读  但如果签约
Please, uh, read it closely, but if you sign it, um,

268
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,670
我将马上开始制定辩护策略
I can get started - on that defense strategy of ours

269
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,460
下午就能开始
this very afternoon.

270
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,350
克雷格...
Craig...

271
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,260
我觉得可以明天再说
I think maybe we should sleep on it.

272
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,630
好吧...  当然
Uh...sure.

273
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,150
你觉得呢  麦吉尔先生
Don't you think, Mr. McGill?

274
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,540
也许我们可以明天再说
Maybe we should sleep on it.

275
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,940
叫我"吉米"就好
Oh, oh, please, call me "Jimmy."

276
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,530
当然可以
A-absolutely.

277
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,960
反正不急
I mean, there's no rush.

278
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,570
对了...  克雷格  我们得去接孩子了
You -- - oh, and, you know, Craig, we got to pick up the kids...

279
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,250
-没错  -就在...  是啊
- Oh. Right. - Yeah. ...at the...yeah. Right.

280
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,380
我们再联系
Well, uh, we will be in touch.

281
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,840
谢谢你请我们喝咖啡  提建议
Oh. Uh, thank you for the coffee and for the advice.

282
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,700
真是太客气了
You're very, very welcome.

283
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,420
给  拿着
Um, here. Take this.

284
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,710
这上面有我的电话号码
It's, uh -- it's got my phone number on it.

285
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,330
-好  行  -知道了
- Yeah. Okay. - Got it.

286
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:34,610
号码是94560054
The number is 9456-0054

287
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,170
4896-0643,

288
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,700
到期日是十一月四日
And the expiration is 11/04.

289
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,290
关键词是"优等"
Okay, and the keyword here is "Classy," all right?

290
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,420
超优等  只用那些看上去很昂贵
Super classy -- use only flowers that look expensive,

291
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,070
但其实很廉价的花
but, you know, aren't.

292
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,840
纸条上应该写  "亲爱的贝茜和克雷格
Uh, and the note should say "Dear Betsy and Craig,"

293
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,600
你们的正义使者在此献上祝福
Uh, "Best wishes from your stickler for justice,

294
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,040
詹姆斯·麦吉尔"
James McGill."

295
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,370
知道了吗  麦吉尔的拼写是...
Okay? And "McGill" is spelled "M-c--"

296
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:06,350
再查一遍  不不不  已经付了钱的
Well, run it again. Oh, no, no, no. It's paid up.

297
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,640
再查一遍
Run it again.

298
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,000
天呐  天呐  天呐
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

299
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,060
天呐
Oh, my God! Ohh.

300
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,140
卡尔  卡尔  看着我
Cal, Cal! Look at me!

301
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,850
伙计  看着我  你没事吧
Buddy, look at me. Are you okay?

302
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,620
说句话吧  你都干了些什么
Say something. What did you do?

303
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,510
-我...  -你对我弟弟干了什么
- I did -- - What did you do to my brother?

304
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,550
你开车的时候怎么不看路
Why don't you look where you're going?!

305
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,140
我正在转弯  他突然冒了出来
I was making a turn! He came out of nowhere!

306
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,800
你他妈把他撞飞了
You freaking -- freaking hit him, man!

307
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,920
-我...  -你从他身上碾了过去
- I did-- - You ran him over!

308
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,550
你从我弟弟身上碾了过去
You ran over my brother!

309
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,000
我把整个过程都拍下来了
And I got the whole thing on video.

310
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,780
这是场意外  是意外
It was an accident. It was an accident.

313
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,690
-我的腿  -你把他腿撞断了
- It's my leg. Oh! - You broke his leg.

314
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,110
你开车都不注意周围吗
Why are you driving around and not looking?!

315
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,910
开车就是为了撞断别人的腿吗
Driving around, breaking people's legs!

316
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,000
这...行了  冷静点
It's -- it's o-- it's -- okay, okay, okay!

不要报警
Don't call the police.

324
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,760
-不要叫警察吗  -不要

325
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,910
那你打算怎么办
How you gonna fix this?

你准备怎么补偿我们
What are you gonna do to make things right?

327
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,500

I don't know, fellas.

328
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,620
我该怎么补偿你们
What can I do to make it right?

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,810
我不知道
I don't know.

331
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,510
五百块
500 bucks?

332
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,660
是吗
Yeah?

333
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,220
搞什么啊  兄弟

再说了  你们真的觉得开这种老爷车的人
Furthermore, does -- does this steaming pile of crap

340

身上有油水可以搾吗
scream "payday" to you, huh?!

341
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,620
里面要是坐个一晚三百的小姐
The only way that entire car is worth 500 bucks

342
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,260
这辆车才能卖到五百元
is if there's a $300 hooker sitting in it.

343
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,410
我们来谈谈撞坏挡风玻璃得赔多少线
Now, let's talk about what you owe me for the windshield.

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,600
有我的信吗
Got my mail?

351
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,480
把死人头切下来操  你还帮他们打官司
You work for people who have sex with chopped-off head?

352
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,120
-都登报纸了吗  -我表兄告诉我的
- Was it in the paper? - I heard it from my cousin.

353
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,890
为什么啊  你为什么给这种人干活
Why? Why you work for these people?

354
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,980
我运气好吧
Just lucky, I guess.

你干预了自然的原始力量  哈姆林先生
You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin,

374
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,170
需要我叫保安吗
Do you want me to call security?

375
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,080
没关系  布兰达  交给我们吧

有何贵干  吉米
What can we do for you, Jimmy?

378
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,060
对不起  都怪这张桌子
I'm sorry. It's -- it's this table.

379
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,760
我有点情不自禁
Something just comes over me.

380
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,460
你可以告诉我这两万六
You can tell me what this, uh, $26,000

381
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,050
是用来干什么的
is supposed to be for.

382
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,930
那是给查克的钱  这不是你想要的结果吗
That's money for Chuck. Isn't that what you wanted?

383
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,990
区区两万六
A measly 26 grand?

384
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,790
这就像彼得·米努伊特对印第安人所做的事
Jesus, you're like Peter Minuit with the Indians.

385
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,790
{\an8}1626年彼得·米努伊特
用价值24美元的珠子和饰物从当地印第安人手里买下了曼哈顿

386
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,040
心情好就扔一些珠子和贝壳给他们
Throw in some beads and shells while you're at it.

387
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,750
这只是个开始
It's just a start.

388
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,490
还会有更多的...
There'll be more --

389
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,700
除非你打算撕碎所有支票
unless you're gonna just tear them all up.

390
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,580
为什么是我收到  为什么不是查克
And why was it made out to me -- why not Chuck?

391
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,500
他能自己去银行吗
Can he make his way to the bank?

392
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,950
我只是认为让你转交
I just assumed it was best

393
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,570
这样最好
to have the money go through you.

394
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,850
我们可以按照你的意愿来完成
We can do it any way you want.

395
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,990
这事不算完  霍华德
This isn't going away, Howard.

396
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,440
查克为这间事务所做的一切
What Chuck did for this firm --

397
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,320
他几乎是一个人完成的
and damn near single-handedly --

398
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,690
这里的三分之一都应该属于他
1/3 of this place belongs to him.

399
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,830
是的  比如这里有十二把椅子
Yeah. What do you got -- 12 chairs here?

400
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,280
那其中就有四把是查克的
Four of these chairs are Chuck's.

401
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,190
你有五个这种发光装置吗
You got five of these light thingumajigs?

402
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,660
那一又三分之二个是查克的
Uh, mm, 1 2/3 are Chuck's.

403
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,090
你们面前有六个丹麦面包  六个吗
Yeah. Six -- how many Danishes -- six Danishes?

404
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,120
-所有面包都可以给你  -不不
- You can have all the Danish you want, Jimmy. - No, no.

405
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,530
他们都属于查克  而查克不是贪心的人
They're Chuck's Danishes, and Chuck isn't greedy,

406
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,530
所以他只要两个...
so h-he'll just take two...

407
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,460
再加上大约一千七百万美元
plus $17 million -- in that ballpark.

408
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,620
我们会知道的
I mean, we'll know

409
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,060
只要我们让会计人员到这里转一圈
once we get the accountants poking around here.

410
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,860
在那之前  不用开什么小额支票
Until then, no more penny-ante checks

411
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,080
好像查克还在这里工作似的
designed to make it look like Chuck still works here.

412
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,130
他不在这里了  再也不会回来了
He doesn't. He never will again.

413
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:42,120
是时候还他公平  并付钱给他了
It's time to do right by him and cash him out.

414
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,490
你转达的这些都是查克自己的意愿吗
So, these are Chuck's own wishes that you're conveying?

415
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,470
这是他最好的选择
This is what's best for him.

416
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,240
是他亲口告诉你
So he personally told you that it's his wish

417
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,880
他想退出事务所吗
to withdraw from the firm?

418
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,930
看来不是  不然我真得吓一跳
See, that would surprise me.

419
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,500
距离他来这里已经快一年了
It's been nearly a year since he's set foot in here.

420
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,270
-我只是为他争取最大利益  -我也是
- I'm just doing what's in his best interests. - So am I.

421
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,490
而我相信他将会很乐意看到这些
And I, for one, believe he's gonna lick this thing.

422
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,700
在他回归之前  他的办公室会保持原样
Until then, his office is just as he left it.

423
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,030
他的秘书也依然有薪水
His secretary's still on payroll.

424
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,630
如果查克把这叫作延长休假
If Chuck can call this an extended sabbatical,

425
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,110
那我们也可以  他对我们就是这么重要
then so can we -- he's that important to us.

426
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,510
这样吧  还是让陪审团来裁定
You know what? Let's let a jury figure it out.

427
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,260
是啊  他们会很爱你的  霍华德
Yeah, they're gonna love you, Howard.

428
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,410
你是那么务实并且可靠
You're so down-to-earth and relatable.

429
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,220
而你...  必将...  赎罪
And you...will...atone!

430
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,920
是《电视台风云》里尼德·巴蒂说的话
It's Ned Beatty, from "Network."

431
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,430
天呐  你们怎么什么都不知道
For christ's sakes, guys.

432
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,410
吉米
Jimmy.

433
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,600
我差点忘了  这个月的法院立案
I almost forgot -- this month's filings.

434
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,830
可以帮我省下邮寄费了
You could save me the postage.

435
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,660
刚才你听到我说的话了吗
W-weren't you listening in there?

436
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,580
查克已经不在这里工作了
Chuck doesn't work here anymore.

437
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,570
你认为我会帮你建立书面记录吗
You think I'm gonna help you establish a paper trail?

438
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,690
-吉米  -不  别想把屎盆子往他身上扣
- Now, Jimmy -- - No, stop trying to pawn that shit off on him.

439
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,910
吉米
Jimmy.

440
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,700
吉米  有时候在我们这行里
You know, Jimmy, sometimes, in our line of work,

441
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,570
容易被取胜的欲望冲昏头脑
you can get so... caught up in the idea of winning

442
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,350
却忘记倾听自己内心的声音
that you forget to listen to your heart.

443
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,500
替我向查克问好  好吗
Give Chuck my love, would you?

444
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,790
原来你在这里啊
Oh, there you are.

445
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,010
贝茜  克雷格
Betsy, Craig.

446
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,800
你好  好的
Hi. Okay.

447
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,110
你今天真漂亮
You look lovely today.

448
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,720
谢谢你这么说
Oh, thank you so much.

449
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:00,890
你能不能...
Couldn't you just --

450
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,310
你明知我做不到
You know, I can't.

451
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,000
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

452
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,160
你手机什么的放信箱了吗
Ground yourself?

453
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,710
是的  放了
Yes, I grounded myself.

454
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,810
你不能再买培根肉了
You got to stop putting bacon on the list,

455
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,010
因为冰箱看起来就像一锅炖旋毛虫
'cause that cooler's looking like a trichinosis stew.

456
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,500
来得正好
Perfect timing.

457
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,850
"布兰斯·弗格森教授"
"Professor Brans Vogelson."

458
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,340
"赫尔辛基大学"
"University of Helsinki"?

459
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,560
是的  你必须把这些翻译过来
Yeah, you're gonna have to get that translated.

460
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,510
-翻译成瑞典语吗  -芬兰语
- Into Swedish? - Finnish.

461
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,060
芬兰语  翻译成...
Finnish, uh, translating into...

462
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,910
我相信新墨西哥大学会有人可以做到
I'm sure there's someone at UNM who can do that.

463
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,850
你知道我打算开一间律师事务所  不是吗
You do know I'm trying to start a legal practice, right?

464
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,080
弗格森正在研究电磁场
Vogelson's been working on the effects

465
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,330
对斑马鱼的影响  还有...
of electromagnetic fields on zebra fish -- and, oh!

466
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,650
《金融时报》
Financial Times.

467
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,560
是啊  我知道你想看
Yeah, I knew you missed it,

468
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,790
所以我想  "管他呢"
so I figured, "What the heck?"

469
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,790
谢谢你  我知道这很贵
Thank you. I know it's expensive.

470
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,020
拿着
Here.

471
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,850
不用  没关系的
That's not -- it's all right.

472
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,910
-我可不希望你自掏腰包  -我...
- I don't expect you to go out of pocket. - I...

473
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,920
拿去  你的酬劳
Go ahead -- reimburse yourself.

474
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,160
谢谢
Thanks.

475
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,650
查克  你能不能先别看那个
Hey, Chuck, um, can you not read that for a second?

476
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,050
我们能谈谈吗
Can we talk?

477
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,290
你还好吗
Are you all right?

478
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,320
你看起来很憔悴
You look peaked.

479
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,550
我没事  请坐下
I'm fine. Please, just sit.

480
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,300
你没遇到麻烦
You're not in trouble.

481
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,420
你得从律所撤股了
Um... You got to cash out.

482
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,060
必须得
You got to.

483
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,700
-又来了  不是吧  -没有别的选择了
- Again? Really? - There's no other way.

484
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,340
我知道你不想听这些  可你必须这样做
I know that you don't want to hear it, but you've got to.

485
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,850
你知道我能渡过这一劫
You know I'm going to beat this.

486
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,780
你知道我会好起来的
You know I'm going to get better.

487
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,550
-当然  -那么
- Yeah, sure. - Well, then,

488
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,610
就没什么好说的了
there's nothing more to talk about.

489
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,220
我会渡过这一劫
I will beat this.

490
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,410
由此  从错误的原理推导[拉丁法律用语]
Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci.

491
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,540
-意思是  -那不是...
- Meaning? - That's not --

492
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,940
-意思是  -那是说原理错误  可我
- Meaning? - That's the one about false principles, but it's not --

493
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,310
你从错误的原理得出结论
You proceed from false principles.

494
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,710
你的辩论毫无根基
Your argument is built on quicksand.

495
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,940
因此也就不攻自破了
Therefore, it collapses.

496
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,610
对对  你没在听我说话
Yeah, yeah. You're not listening.

497
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,510
好吧
Fine.

498
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,120
让我们得出合乎逻辑的结论
Let's take this to its logical conclusion.

499
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,700
为了支付我的股份
In order to pay out my share,

500
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,650
假设我的合伙人会被迫清算律所
suppose my partners are forced to liquidate the firm.

501
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,470
-然后呢  -那是他们的问题
- Then what? - That's their problem.

502
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,820
我的委托人会被扫地出门
My clients are out in the cold.

503
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,620
我的案子都要完蛋
My cases are scattered to the winds.

504
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,210
一百二十六个人会失业
126 people lose their jobs.

505
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,830
你那些收发室的好朋友该怎么办
What happens to your cronies in the mailroom,

506
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:47,310
还有那些律师  律师助理  保洁工人
the assistants, the paralegals, the janitorial staff?

507
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,580
全都会流落街头
All of them, out on the street.

508
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,750
你的好朋友金  一份好前途转眼成灰
Your friend Kim -- a promising career -- over and done with.

509
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,530
一切都是哈姆林欠你的
Hamlin owes you everything.

510
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,240
你一手打造了这间律所
You built that place single-handedly

511
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,870
他那时还在四山俱乐部练习沙坑球呢
while he was out at Four Hills working on his bunker shot.

512
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,510
不要说那么夸张  我是帮了忙而已
Let's not exaggerate. I helped.

513
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,890
帮忙而已
You helped.

514
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,390
所以就更没必要为了点小钱
All the more reason not to tear it down

515
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,540
把这一切都毁了啊
just for a little bit of cash.

516
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,510
听我说  查克  我快完了  好吗
Look...Chuck, I'm going under -- okay? --

517
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,010
第三次接手这些狗屁合约官司...
For the third time with these bull-crap contract counsel --

518
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,870
怎么是"狗屁" 
"Bull crap"?

519
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:16,050
这些七百块一件的狗屁小公设律师活
Bull-crap, pissant P.D. cases at 700 bucks a shot.

520
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:19,440
公设辩护律师可是律师最难得的经历之一
Public-defender work is some of the best experience there is.

521
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,760
我刚刚经手一个案子  查克  三个委托人
I just had a case, Chuck, with three clients --

522
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,410
提讯  预审  庭审
Uh, arraignments, voir dire, jury trial --

523
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,580
全套下来
The whole nine yards.

524
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,100
你知道我挣了多少钱吗  七百块
You know what I took home? 700 bucks.

525
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,910
还不如去贫民窟卖血赚得多
Yeah, I might as well head down to skid row and sell plasma.

526
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,920
你代表的都是些走投无路的人
You're representing people who have nowhere else to turn.

527
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,200
钱不是问题
The money is beside the point.

528
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,660
钱就是问题
Money is not beside the point -- money is the point.

529
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,960
我一直告诉你  要有耐心
I keep telling you -- have patience.

530
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,060
没有捷径可走
There are no shortcuts.

531
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,330
把工作干好  自然会有委托人找上门
Do good work, and the clients will come.

532
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,400
自然会有委托人找上门  对  我明白
The clients will come. Yeah, I know.

533
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,670
好吧
Okay.

534
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,750
对天发誓
Hand to God,

535
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,560
我本不打算这样说  可你破产了
I wasn't gonna say this, but you are broke.

536
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,620
我负担不了我们两个人
I can't carry both of us.

537
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,330
我已经使出了吃奶的劲  可我做不到
I've been trying like hell, but I can't.

538
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,410
你这是在说什么
Well, you're saying what?

539
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,180
你以为我需要你来养吗
You think you have to provide for me?

540
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,080
我从没让你这样做
I never asked you that.

541
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,520
你根本不用开口  好吗
You didn't have to ask, okay?

542
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,050
我已经尽我最大努力了
I've been doing my damnedest,

543
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,690
但我也快熬到头了
but the day of reckoning is here.

544
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,320
很快  查克  你就要流落街头了
Soon, Chuck, you're gonna be out on the street

545
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,560
到时候全世界的电磁场都会碾过你
with all the electromagnetism in the world raining down on you.

546
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,600
拜托  拜托  好好想象一下那场景
Now, please, please, picture that,

547
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,280
然后再告诉我钱不是问题
then tell me that money is beside the point.

548
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,120
让你烦恼的就是这事吗
This is what has you all worked up?

549
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,340
对
Yeah!

550
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,440
吉米  没什么好担心的
Jimmy...There's nothing to worry about.

551
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,320
-给  -这是什么
- Here. - What is this?

552
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,370
一笔津贴  以后每周都会有
A stipend -- there's gonna be one every week.

553
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,820
哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所给的857美元
$857 from Hamlin Hamlin & Mcgill?

554
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,610
我会一分不差地还给他们
I'm gonna pay them back -- every penny.

555
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:43,290
我本不想要的  但霍华德坚持要给我
I didn't want to take anything, but Howard was very insistent.

556
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,450
我也会全还给你的
And I'm gonna pay you back, too.

557
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,540
等等  哈姆林来过了吗
Wait, Hamlin was here?

558
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,420
我又不是闭门谢客的隐士
It's not like I'm a recluse.

559
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,190
怎么  他把手机留在信箱里了吗
What? He put his cellphone in the mailbox?

560
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,350
他理解我的情况
He understands the situation.

561
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,400
他真的放了吗
He grounded himself?

562
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,470
当然
Of course.

563
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,090
然后你们两个达成一致  既然众所周知
And the two of you agreed that since, as everybody knows,

564
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,800
你随时都可能回去工作
you're going back to work any day now,

565
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,000
律所理应帮你贴补家用
that the firm should help you make ends meet.

566
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,390
除去你话里的讽刺味  正是这样
That's correct, minus the sarcasm.

567
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,290
哈姆林这是把你当傻子玩
Hamlin's making you a chump!

568
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,160
我会好起来的
I'm going to get better!

569
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,970
我会回去工作
I'm gonna go back to work,

570
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,090
从哪里跌倒就从哪里爬起来
and I'm picking up where I left off!

571
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,120
对不起
Sorry.

572
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,630
查克  对不起
Sorry, Chuck.

573
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,980
我知道  你一直都想帮我
I understand that you're trying to look out for me,

574
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,740
但你现在因小失大了
but you're missing the bigger picture.

575
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,280
我知道
I got it.

576
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,190
还有件事
Speaking of which...

577
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,250
霍华德拿来了这个
Howard brought this.

578
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,120
他有点担忧
He's concerned.

579
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,040
什么
What?

580
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,300
你得承认  这容易让人混淆
You have to admit -- it could be confusing --

581
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,950
他的公司名是哈姆林·哈姆林·麦吉尔
Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill?

582
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,630
你的律所叫詹姆斯·M·麦吉尔
James M. Mcgill?

583
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,320
我就叫这名字
That's my name.

584
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,820
我打小就叫这名字
I was born with it. I...

585
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,090
那也不行
Still...

586
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,050
要不改叫先锋律所吧
How about Vanguard Law?

587
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,670
-那直布罗陀法律公司怎么样  -等等
- Or Gi...Gibraltar Legal... - Wait, wait.

588
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:27,040
所以因为哈姆林  我还不能用自己的名字了
So I'm not supposed to use my name o-on Hamlin's say-so?

589
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,540
他这是什么意思  要起诉我吗
W-- what's he gonna do -- sue me?

590
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,270
谁也不想给自己找麻烦
Nobody wants to create an adversarial situation.

591
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,460
霍华德肯定愿意付钱给你
I'm sure Howard would gladly pay the cost

592
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,470
做个新火柴盒广告
of new matchbooks and so on.

593
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,560
这只是职业礼节罢了
It's simply a matter of professional courtesy.

594
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,780
查克  你到底是哪边的
Chuck, whose side are you on?

595
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,530
什么哪边不哪边
There are no sides.

596
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,050
不过  吉米
But, Jimmy...

597
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,750
你难道不想打出自己的牌子吗
Wouldn't you rather build your own identity?

598
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,780
别总想沾别人的光
Why ride on someone else's coattails?

599
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,480
霍华德  你想跳舞吗
You want to dance, Howard?

600
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:20,670
那我们就跳吧
Let's dance.

601
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,450
滑
Go!

602
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,830
你能不能滑得再靠近我一点  废物
No, you can get closer than that, you bitch.

603
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,080
快点
Come on.

604
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,020
对  就这样
And here it comes.

605
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,460
不错  好点儿了
There you go. Better.

606
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,140
我滑得怎么样
How was that?

607
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,520
都给你录了  你看
It's right on here. Take a look.

608
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,510
还是那句话  身体要绷紧
Still, tighter is everything.

609
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,350
绷紧  什么呀  什么绷紧
T-tighter? What? T-tighter what?

610
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,610
我也说不清  就是站着的时候要绷紧
I don't know. Just stand...Tighter.

611
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,590
-你听懂没  -没有
- You know what I mean? - I don't know what you mean.

612
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,750
你真笨  就是选择一种风格
That sucked. We can call that a stylistic choice, I guess,

613
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,360
-如果你想  -你们俩
- If you want to... - Hey, fellas.

614
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,030
我这里有大生意给你们
We got business.

615
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,840
你怎么知道我们在这里
How did you find us?

616
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:12,220
挺奇怪的  是吧
I know, eerie, right?

617
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,260
等等  就耽误你们30秒
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on. Give me 30 seconds.

618
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,330
这说不定是你们人生中最有价值的30秒
Could be the most profitable 30 seconds of your lives.

619
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,700
我给你们讲个故事吧  有个小伙子
Let me tell you about a young guy.

620
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:36,560
他其实和你们差不多大
Actually, he's about your age.

621
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,260
住在离这里很远的地方
He lived a long way from here

622
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,740
就在伊利诺伊州的西塞罗市
in a town called Cicero, Illinois.

623
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,220
在那里  他可是个人物
And in Cicero, he was the man.

624
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,820
这么说吧  他走在街上
I mean, when he strolled down the street,

625
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,180
所有小混混都会和他击掌打招呼
all the corner boys would give him the high five.

626
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,960
所有漂亮妞儿都会冲他笑
All the finest babes would smile at him

627
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,350
巴望着他也能回一个笑容
and hope that he would smile back.

628
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,150
大家都叫他"风流吉米"
They called him "Slippin' Jimmy,"

629
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,370
所有人都想和他做朋友
and everybody wanted to be his friend.

630
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,900
"风流吉米"
"Slippin' Jimmy"?

631
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,110
这是什么狗屁绰号
What the hell kind of name is that?

632
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,160
听我说
Well, I'll tell you, now --

633
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,160
西塞罗的冬天冷得能冻死人
Winters in Cicero are murder.

634
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,770
你们在金色的西部长大的
You guys growing up out here in the golden west --

635
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,540
根本体会不到那有多冷
y-you don't know, okay?

636
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,110
那里的冬天能把你的鼻涕冻住
I'm talking cold that'll freeze the snot right in your nose.

637
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,200
那寒风能割裂你的夹克衫
I'm talking wind that'll cut through your jacket

638
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,450
{\an8}金厨 著名厨房刀具品牌

639
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,450
然后像一把金厨刀一样把你切碎
And carve you up like a Ginsu knife.

640
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,010
总之  西塞罗的大部分居民都很害怕冬天
In fact, most folks in Cicero were scared of winter,

641
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:36,340
但吉米可不怕
but not Jimmy.

642
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,880
夏天的时候  他就等啊等
Jimmy waited around all summer,

643
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,120
九月终于来了
and when September finally rolled around

644
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,070
他感受到了第一股凉风
and he'd feel that first cold wind

645
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:48,600
从密歇根湖吹来  他知道  它要来了
come sweeping off Lake Michigan, he knew it was coming.

646
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,590
{\an8}宽扎节  非裔美国人节日

647
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,590
他等的是圣诞节吗  是宽扎节吗
Was it Christmas? Was it Kwanzaa?

648
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:54,690
都不是  是一年一度的碰瓷季
Better -- it was Slip 'n Fall season.

649
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,910
很快  等到外面已经变得非常冷
Soon as it was cold enough,

650
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,760
他就找一块光滑结冰的地面
he'd find a nice, smooth patch of ice.

651
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,790
州级公路也行  密歇根大道更好
State street was good. Michigan Avenue was better.

652
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,010
他选好点  等到路上人多的时候
He'd pick his spot, wait for it to get busy,

653
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,900
他就踩着那冰片滑过去  然后  轰的一声
Then he'd walk out on the ice, and -- boom!

654
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,250
他摔得那么狠
He would biff it so hard,

655
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,880
五个街区外的人都跑来看
people would come running from five blocks away.

656
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,170
那他碰瓷碰成了吗
Yeah, but did he collect?

657
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,090
"成了吗"
"Did he collect?"

658
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:19,440
"风流吉米"从来没失败过
Slippin' jimmy had it dialed in, all right?

659
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,800
摔一次  他就能要来六千或者八千块
One good fall -- he'd clear 6, 8 grand.

660
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,540
那些钱够他每天喝老密尔沃基酒  吸大麻
That'd keep him in Old Milwaukee and maui wowie

661
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,190
一直用到劳动节
right through Labor Day.

662
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,570
八千块啊
8 grand?

663
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,250
没错
8 grand.

664
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,220
我觉得你们都是潜力股
Now, see, I look at you guys, I see potential.

665
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,680
你们用滑板碰瓷很妙
The skateboard's a nice wrinkle --

666
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,490
全年都可以干
that makes it a year-round gig.

667
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,830
很明显  你非常清楚怎么去摔  对吗
And clearly, you know how to take a header, right?

668
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:41,890
但我得问你  收成最好的一天
But I got to ask you -- your best day ever,

669
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,430
赚了多少钱
how much did you clear?

670
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,950
-630  -630
- $630. - $630.

671
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,450
六百三十块吗
630 bucks.

672
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,810
是摔一次的钱数吗
Was that for one fall?

673
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,880
-两次  -一天摔两次
- Two. - Two falls in one day.

674
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,050
即使是你们这年纪  也会很疼吧
Even at your age, that's got to hurt.

675
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,500
确实疼啊
True that.

676
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:03,930
好吧  我给你们一个活儿
All right, well, I got a job for you.

677
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,050
两千块怎么样
How's 2 grand sound?

678
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,590
摔一次给两千块吗
2 grand for one hit?

679
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,090
就一次
One hit.

680
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,810
而且  你还能跟最好的人学习
Plus, you get to learn from the best.

681
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,060
船不错
Nice boat.

682
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,850
是啊  藏得很隐蔽
Yeah, discreet,

683
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,630
就跟清真寺里的钢管舞杆一样
like a stripper pole in a mosque.

684
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,630
别管那船了  看那辆车
Yeah, forget the boat. Look at the car.

685
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,660
知道是什么车吗
You know what that is?

686
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,370
不知道  旅行车吗
I don't know. A station wagon?

687
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,340
那是辆水星  1988年的水星黑貂休旅车
It's a Mercury, a 1988 Mercury Sable wagon.

688
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,970
记住它  烙在脑子里  记住了吗
Remember it. Burn it into your brains. You got it?

689
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,230
没问题  水星黑貂休旅车
It's a Mercury Sable Wagon, sure.

690
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,660
闭上眼  车是什么颜色
Close your eyes. What color is it?

691
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,310
-棕色  -棕色
- Brown. - Brown.

692
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,710
不  是中檀色  闭着眼睛
No, it's medium sandalwood. Keep your eyes closed.

693
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,710
车牌号开始是几
How does the license plate start?

694
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,280
-4  -4
- 4. - 4.

695
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,780
给你们一个金星奖章
Give those gentlemen a gold star.

696
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,790
她的名字是贝茜·凯特尔曼
Betsy Kettleman's her name.

697
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,380
每个工作日2点25和2点50之间
Every weekday between 2:25 and 2:50,

698
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,460
她都会经过这里去基特·卡森小学
she comes through here on her way to pick up her kids

699
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,400
接孩子
at Kit Carson elementary.

700
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,270
现在你需要找到一个她会减速的地方
Now, you need a place where she's gonna slow down --

701
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,590
-我说的对吗  -是的
- Am I right? - Yeah.

702
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,700
好了  在那儿  她减速了
All right. Well, there you go. She slows down.

703
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,200
她稍往右靠  你从那边冲出来
She hangs a right. You come shooting out of there.

704
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,430
把你对我那一套拿出来  翻个屁滚尿流
You do what you did to me. You go ass over teakettle.

705
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,250
摔出一流水平
You make it a blue-ribbon special.

706
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,360
她从车上下来以后
When she gets out of the car,

707
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,860
你正疼得要命  对吗
you're sufferin' St. Sebastian, right?

708
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,050
你是重头戏  知道吗  直接走到她面前
You're the hammer, okay? You get in her face.

709
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,740
把她吓到灵魂出窍
You scare the bejesus out of her.

710
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,010
把手机给我
Give me your phone.

711
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,200
这人很多  你不觉得吗
It's kind of busy here, don't you think?

712
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,550
有目击者是好事
Well, witnesses are good.

713
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:26,210
目击者能提供压力  知道吗
Witnesses are pressure, all right?

714
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,990
一旦你完全吓住了她
Now, once you've got her good and rattled,

715
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,670
然后你就打电话叫救护车
then you call for an ambulance,

716
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,530
但实际上  你是在给我打电话
but really, you're calling for me.

717
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,150
我在你快速拨号的第一个
I'm number one on your speed dial,

718
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:35,560
就在你的大麻贩子的旁边
right next to your weed dealer.

719
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,540
你打给我  我会火速赶来
You call me. I hotfoot it over here.

720
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,760
我只是"恰好"开车路过
I just "happen" to be driving by.

721
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,390
我停下看有什么麻烦
I stop to see what the trouble is,

722
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,530
最重要的一点是  你们不认识我
and this is the most important part -- you don't know me.

723
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,440
我们从没见过  知道吗
We've never met. You got it?

724
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,840
-当然  -好的
- Sure. - Okay.

725
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,790
现在  我会是凯特尔曼太太的救星
Now, I'm Mrs. K's white knight.

726
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,230
我们一对一交谈
We go mano a mano.

727
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,140
然后你过来收拾我  狠一点  但不要动手
You light into me, okay? Get nasty. And no touching.

728
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,300
别弄乱发型
Leave the hair alone.

729
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,320
除此之外  自由发挥
But otherwise, you know, open season.

730
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,520
大喊  跺脚  骂我是个混蛋
Yell. Stomp. Call me a douche bag.

731
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,700
我会装作没事
I'm gonna play it cool,

732
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,370
让你一个人在那儿闹
give you back some of the razzmatazz.

733
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,370
一旦她看过了这一出
And once she's seen the fireworks,

734
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,960
你就像折叠椅一样收住
you fold like a lawn chair --

735
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,190
皆大欢喜
happy ending.

736
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,550
我们什么时候拿到钱
When do we get our money?

737
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:12,820
事后
After.

738
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,800
-事后  -事后吗
- After. - After.

739
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,150
我拿到钱你们就拿到钱
You get paid when I get paid.

740
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,500
我才是推动整个事件发展的人
I'm the rising tide that raises all dinghies.

741
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,390
好了  快速测验  什么车
Now, pop quiz -- what's the car?

742
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,770
水星黑貂休旅车  婴儿屎棕色
Mercury Sable wagon. Baby-poop brown.

743
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,750
-好  你们认识我吗  -不认识
- Okay. Do you know me? - No.

744
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,020
太棒了  上帝与你们同在
Damn straight. Go with god.

745
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,320
我很高兴我恰好路过
Well, I'm just glad I happened to be passing by.

746
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,080
很高兴帮助你  贝茜
Happy to be of help, Betsy.

747
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,550
我能叫你"贝茜"吗
