21
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,430
我丈夫和我节衣缩食过了很多年
My husband and I scrimped and saved for so many years.

22
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,800
为了不成为家庭的负担
We did our best to build a nest egg

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,050
我们尽力攒下了一笔养老金
so that we wouldn't be a burden to our family.

24
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,900
罗纳德去世后  我搬进了一家生活协助中心
After Ronald passed, I moved to an assisted-living facility --

25
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,670
很不错的地方
a nice place.

26
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,020
他们说会照顾好一切
They told me they'd take care of everything,

27
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,640
但有一天  他们说我一分钱都没了
but then, one day, they said all my money was gone.

28
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,750
怎么会这样
How could that be?

29
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,680
钱都去哪儿了
Where did it all go?

30
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,570
如果你或爱人
If you or a loved one

31
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,140
是矶鹞渡生活协助中心
is a resident of a Sandpiper crossing facility

32
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,140
或是其他有关退休社区的居民
or other associated retirement community...

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,890
天啊  你自己配的音吗
Jesus. ‭You used your own voice?

34
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,660
你也许有资格
...You may be eligible to

35
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,230
-获得补偿  -为了省钱
- receive compensation. - Strictly to save money.

36
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,420
-总共才花了  -行了
- All in, the whole thing cost -- - Just --

电话505-242-7700
That's 505-242-7700.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,110
制作成本总共才647美元
The production costs -- $647, all in.

42
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,320
播出一次的广告费才七百  便宜到家了
The one single airing was a $700 ad buy, so dirt-cheap.

43
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,210
你觉得这是因为钱吗
You think this is about money?

44
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,670
我们找你来是因为钱吗
You think that's what this is about?

45
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,130
我只是尽量提供全面的信息
I'm just trying to offer complete information here.

46
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,930
这次播出  只是一个实验
Now, this one airing -- it was an experiment,

47
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,520
而且不管怎么说  都是一次成功的实验
and as such, by any measure, a success.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
你一直说"实验实验"
You keep using the word "Experiment"

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,530
好像你是该死的莱特兄弟似的
like you're ‭the goddamned Wright brothers.

50
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,070
你到底准备什么时候告诉我们这个"实验"
When exactly were you gonna tell us about this experiment?

51
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,750
今天
Today.

52
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,810
就今早
This morning.

53
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,720
我承认我有点操之过急了
I-I admit, I got a little ahead of myself,

54
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,440
有点过于激动了
a little...exuberant.

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,220
我为此道歉
And for that, I apologize.

56
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,860
但我认为最重要的是
But the headline here is -- I think --

57
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,890
广告播出后我们已经接到将近两百通来电了
we've gotten nearly 200 phone calls since this one airing.

58
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,900
克利福德  昨晚我俩聊过后
Cliff, since you and I spoke last night,

59
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,190
又多了七十二通
72 more.

60
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,870
听到了吗  外面响起的就是胜利的号角
You hear that? Right there -- that's the sound of victory.

61
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,120
吉米  别自圆其说了
Jimmy, stop selling.

62
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,820
别装作对真正的问题视而不见
And don't act like ‭you don't see the problem here.

63
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,460
我没觉得有问题啊
I don't.

64
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,400
你不跟我们打招呼
You cut us out.

65
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,040
绕过我们自行其是
You did an end run around us.

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,750
"过于激动"才不是什么借口
Exuberance is no excuse.

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,150
克利福德
Cliff.

68
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,250
客户联系由我负责
Client outreach is my department.

69
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,700
你第一天就跟我说清楚了
Now, you told me that from day one.

70
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,590
吉米  那如果我让你负责发工资
Jimmy, if I put you in charge of payroll, would that mean

71
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,130
那你给每个人发一百万奖金我都得同意咯
I'd be okay with you giving everyone a million-dollar bonus?

72
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,000
我俩讨论过广告的可行性啊
You and I did discuss the possibility of a commercial.

73
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,990
理论上的可行性而已
The possibility in the abstract,

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,880
而且还是我出门前的短短三十秒内谈的
for a grand total of 30 seconds when I was halfway out the door.

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,420
我还以为我听出了你的热情
I guess -- I thought I heard enthusiasm,

76
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
所以我就稍微自作主张了点
so I-I took some initiative.

77
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,720
"稍微"
"Some."

78
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,580
戴维斯梅因是个团队
We are a team at Davis & Main.

79
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,300
讲究的是团队合作
This is a team approach.

80
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,240
你来之前还是个独立从业者
You coming to us ‭as a solo practitioner --

81
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,850
我知道你还需要一段时间的学习
I knew there was gonna be a learning curve.

82
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,470
但如果你就是学不会融入这个团队
But if you simply can't fit in as part of the team --

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,760
我可以融入  我融入了啊
I can fit in. I-I fit in.

84
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,780
我是来帮你们和HHM打赢矶鹞渡的官司的
I am here to help you and HHM win Sandpiper.

85
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,210
所以我才会这么做
That's all this was about.

86
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,970
我们可没指望着矶鹞渡过活
Sandpiper's not what keeps the lights on around here.

87
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,770
我们有的客户不想跟这种...东西
We have clients who wouldn't want to be associated

88
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,890
联系在一起
with this kind of... this.

89
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,780
我们的形象和名誉
Our image, our reputation

90
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,310
是我们小心经营多年才打造起来的
is something we've been carefully building for years.

91
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,700
比任何案子都重要
It's worth far more than any one case.

92
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,050
这样的行为会损害名誉
Something like this could damage it.

93
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,380
这么说吧
Suffice it to say,

94
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,770
现在我们几位都对你没什么好感
there's not a lot of love for you in the room at the moment.

95
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,850
投票结果二比一  要因为你的不当行为解雇你
The vote is currently two to one to fire you for cause.

96
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,290
不过
However...

97
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,630
我相信要给人第二次机会
I believe in second chances.

98
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,960
但是再犯一次就三振出局
But know this is both strike one and strike two.

99
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,960
三振出局法
有两次犯罪前科的罪犯第三次犯罪时从重量刑

100
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,010
今后你将受到更严格的监督
Going forward, you can expect a great deal more scrutiny.

101
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,220
快接  快接
Come on. Come on.

102
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,550
你好
Hello.

103
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,370
这是金·韦克斯勒的语音信箱
You've reached the voicemail of Kim Wexler.

104
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,280
请留言
Please leave me a message,

105
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,020
我会尽快回复你
And I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

106
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,870
金
Hey, kim.

107
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,200
尽快打给我  好吗
I need you to call me as soon as you can, all right?

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,620
时间很关键
It's a time-sensitive thing, so, uh,

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,210
我是说  我可能...
I mean, I may have, uh, just --

110
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,080
麻烦你在跟霍华德谈之前打给我好吗
Well, please call me before you talk to Howard, okay?

111
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,880
再见
Bye.

112
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,170
未接来电
一条语音消息

113
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,470
很简单的问题  金
It's a simple question, Kim --

114
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,680
你知不知道这条广告
Did you or did you not know about this commercial?

115
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,150
我知道
I -- yes.

116
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,810
他给我看了
He showed it to me.

117
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,890
他给你看了吗
He showed it to you?

118
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,180
是的  几天前
Yes. A few days ago.

119
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,280
这事儿你没跟任何人说吗
And you didn't say anything to anyone?

120
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,180
没有
No. I didn't.

121
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,180
你不觉得该跟我说一声吗
You didn't think I deserved a heads-up?

122
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,450
我没想到
I didn't realize --

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,840
当时我觉得没必要
At the time, ‭I didn't think it was necessary.

124
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,500
那你想错了
Well, you were wrong about that.

125
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,750
我们被合伙律师问了个措手不及
We were caught flat-footed in front of our co-counsel,

126
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,750
不用我跟你解释  这对HHM的影响很不好
which I don't need to tell you, does not reflect well on HHM.

127
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,160
对你也不好
Or on you.

128
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,450
就这样吧
That'll be all.

129
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,260
你可以走了
You can go.

130
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,820
你准备怎么办
What are you going to do?

131
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,830
你觉得呢
So, what do you think?

132
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,870
我觉得从这里可以很清楚地观察对面
I figure from here, you've got a good bead on the place,

133
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,490
但里面的人  他们发现不了你
but someone inside -- they can't pick you out.

134
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,150
屠库和我  就在那里
Tuco and me -- that's our spot.

135
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,520
他总是面朝外坐着
He always sits facing out,

136
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,880
把场面搞得像黑帮一样
makes it look like it's a gangster thing,

137
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,200
但他是为了盯着自己的车
but I know it's just so he can keep an eye on his ride.

138
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,120
每个周二  我们都来这里收账
Every Tuesday, ‭we're here squaring accounts.

139
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,070
毒贩子过来  付掉欠款
Dealer comes in, pays what he owes.

140
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,980
屠库  他喜欢跟他们面对面
Tuco -- he likes to get face-to-face.

141
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,010
他说他想知道的一切都写在脸上
Says everything he needs to know is written right here.

142
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,920
看着他们的眼睛
Looks 'em in the eyes.

143
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
死盯着  好像要把他们看穿
Just stares, like he's looking inside of 'em.

144
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,660
我见过他一盯就盯上五分钟十分钟
I've seen him go like that 5, 10 minutes.

145
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,190
为什么要那么做
And what does that accomplish?

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,090
他把这叫做测谎仪
Calls it his lie detector.

147
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,670
所以这事得持续一整天
That's why these things go all day.

148
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,170
就你俩吗  没帮手了吗
Just the two of you? No extra muscle?

149
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,300
不需要  我们自己能搞定
Don't need it. ‭We can handle our business.

150
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,960
不过得花好几个钟头
Anyway, it takes hours.

151
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,910
收钱  数钱  测谎
Collect the cash, count it, lie detector.

152
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,530
一次进来一个  交易  然后下一个
One at a time -- guy comes in, transacts, then the next.

153
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,930
完事之后  屠库上他的车  我上我的
Then, when we're done, Tuco gets in his car, I get in mine.

154
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,580
然后各走各的
Boom. We go our separate ways.

155
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,560
这时候就该你上了
That is where you come in.

156
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,440
当你看到他在收拾了  就开过去
You see him packing up -- wsssh -- drive over.

157
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,080
停在屠库旁边的车位
Pull up in the spot next to Tuco's.

158
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,340
砰  爆头
Pop. Head shot.

159
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,070
开车走人  很简单
Roll out. Easy.

160
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,560
40号公路的上匝道就在那边八个街区外
I-40 onramp is eight blocks up.

161
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,810
别人还没反应过来  你就已经没了踪影
You're in the wind ‭before anyone has time to blink.

162
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,600
更好的是  这些毒贩子
And here's the beauty -- all these, um, dealers?

163
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,730
都知道我们在这  所以故事可以这么编
They know we're here, so the story is,

164
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,240
他们其中一个想要杀死屠库
one of them got ideas, decided to kill Tuco,

165
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,340
从这生意中捞一笔
get a cut of the business.

166
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,350
在贩毒集团看来  可能是任何一个人
Could've been any of them, as far as the cartel's concerned.

167
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,270
这些星期二
These Tuesdays of yours --

168
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,210
结束的时候是白天还是晚上
Day or night when you wrap it up?

169
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,300
-白天  -所以就是光天化日
- Day. - ‭So, full daylight.

170
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,460
过往车辆也很多
Plenty of traffic.

171
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,480
我怎样才能不被看见呢
How exactly do I not get seen?

172
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,400
我的车总会被看见吧
My car, at least.

173
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,030
墨菲定律告诉我  有人会记下车牌的
Murphy's Law tells me somebody's gonna pull a plate.

174
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,030
会出错的  终将出错

175
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,490
好吧  那就去车场买辆旧车
Fine. ‭Go to the yard. Buy a beater.

176
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,000
你就待在车里
You're gonna stay in the car.

177
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,640
没人会看见你
‭Ain't no one gonna see you.

178
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,460
就算看到你了  那又怎样
And if they do see you, so what?

179
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,740
这就是你为什么是完美人选
That's why you're perfect.

180
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,940
你很不起眼  没谁也没联系
You're no one. You got no connections.

181
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,930
你就是个幽灵
You're a ghost.

182
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,300
所以我停在他旁边
So, I pull in next to him --

183
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,000
那得假定有停车的地方
That assumes there's a parking spot.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,530
毒贩子都停在他车旁边
Our guys park next to him.

185
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,920
来去都是同一个车位
They come and go from the same spot.

186
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,690
最后一个人走了  你就可以上了
Last one takes off, you're open.

187
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,760
要是有人停在我后面  我就被堵了
Someone comes in behind me, I'm blocked.

188
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,710
谁会停在你后面啊
Who's gonna pull in behind you?

189
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,580
来吃玉米卷饼的人
Well, I'm guessing someone who likes tacos.

190
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,380
那该怎么办
What then?

191
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,310
我该怎么离开
What's my exit?

192
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,120
不知道
I don't know.

193
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,770
下车跑路
Get out and run.

194
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,460
我膝盖不好
Bad knees.

195
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,670
我付钱就是让你搞定这些细节的
Look, the details -- that's what I'm paying you for.

196
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,710
你要是有更好的计划  请告诉我
You've got a better plan, go on, tell me.

197
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,940
我洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

198
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,710
你确定要这么干吗
You sure about this?

199
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,730
杀死你的同伙
Killing your partner --

200
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,580
干了就没有回头路了
that's a bell you don't un-ring.

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,750
看到了吗
See this?

202
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,810
你知道这是怎么弄的吗
You know how I got this?

203
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,220
九六  九七年的时候  屠库和我
Back in '96, '97, Tuco and I

204
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,260
和一群河滨县的飞车党合作
were working with these bikers out of Riverside County.

205
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,040
他们卖低纯度冰毒
They were running ‭this peanut-butter crank --

206
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,240
质量次得很
Real shit, y'know?

207
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,370
但是便宜  我们拿到手很快就卖完了
But cheap, and we could sell it as fast as we got it.

208
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,300
后来屠库也用上了
Anyway, ‭Tuco develops a taste for it.

209
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,340
这毒品把人变得很坏
And crank does not bring out the best in people.

210
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,580
让屠库发疯
Made Tuco erratic.

211
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,750
我们的联络人是一个叫道格·保尔森的人
Our connect ‭was a guy called Dawg Paulson.

212
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,470
有一天  屠库和道格见面
One day, ‭Tuco's settling up with Dawg.

213
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,260
决定对他测测谎
He decides ‭to put on his lie detector.

214
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,390
道格说"你要干嘛"
Dawg's like, ‭"What the hell?" You know.

215
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,130
屠库就一直死盯着他
Tuco just keeps staring at him.

216
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,740
然后他就不说话了
Then he goes real quiet.

217
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,500
"你觉得我是傻逼吗  道格"
"You think I'm an idiot, Dawg?"

218
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,150
他认为道格在给他的竞争对手供货
He thinks Dawg is supplying his competitor,

219
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,490
想要把屠库踢出去
trying to cut Tuco out.

220
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,880
道格矢口否认
Dawg -- he denies it.

221
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,360
"不可能  不是我"
"No way! Not me!"

222
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,920
屠库都没有提高嗓门  但突然间
Tuco doesn't even ‭raise his voice, but suddenly,

223
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,700
他掏出削短霰弹枪
he's got a sawed-off and...

224
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,040
一枪崩了道格的脸
right in Dawg's face.

225
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,330
我就站在他身后
I was behind him.

226
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,090
那是我至今为止见过最恶心的画面
Sickest thing I ever saw, to this day.

227
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,480
而这
And this?

228
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,110
是道格的头骨碎片
A piece of Dawg's skull --

229
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,990
一小块钻到皮肤下面去了
Under the skin, a little piece of him.

230
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,650
我试过挖出来  但它就是不肯出来
I tried digging it out, but it's in there pretty good.

231
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,070
这事可不能去找医生
Anyway, not the kinda thing you go to the doctor's for.

232
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,300
其实我想说  屠库很喜欢道格
The thing about it was, Tuco really liked dawg.

233
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,980
后来他也有点后悔
Kind of felt bad afterwards.

234
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,580
但当他吸了毒  就疯了
But when he's using, loco, crazy.

235
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,050
根本无法形容
There's no other way to put it.

236
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,270
现在他又开始吸毒了
And he's using again.

237
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,340
纯度更高的  劲儿更大
Crystal -- much bigger kick.

238
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
所以跟你说的一样
So... It's like you said.

239
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,720
如果屠库发现了我在外面的私活儿
If Tuco finds out about my, y'know, independent ventures,

240
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,550
我就会落得跟道格一样的下场
it's gonna be Dawg all over again.

241
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,380
有我没他
It's him or me.

242
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,070
那里
There.

243
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,090
用装了瞄准器的枪就可以击中
A man with a scoped rifle could get a clean shot.

244
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,760
就一发子弹
Fire a single round,

245
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,210
在有人反应过来之前消失
disappear before anybody knew what had happened.

246
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,870
没有目击者  还可以顺利逃脱
No witnesses. Clean egress.

247
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,910
很远啊
Pretty far.

248
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,530
你打得中吗
You can make that shot?

249
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,020
打得中
Yeah.

250
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,400
你同意干了吗
You saying you'll do it?

251
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,010
五万
50 grand?

252
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:38,970
那就五万
50 grand.

253
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,330
我会办好的
I'll look into it.

254
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
你哥哥不在这  麦吉尔先生
Your brother isn't here, Mr. Mcgill.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,680
我知道
I know.

256
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,370
他让我来拿他的吸墨纸
Uh, he sent me to get his ink blotter.

257
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,500
-就一会  -小心点
- I'll just be a second. - ‭Watch yourself.

258
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,630
地很滑
The floor's slick.

259
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,400
多谢  杰苏阿尔多
Oh, thank you, Gesualdo.

260
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,850
抱歉踩脏了
Sorry about the floor!

261
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,130
不是吧
Oh, no.

262
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,030
你在找韦克斯勒小姐吗
Are you looking for Ms. Wexler?

263
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,540
没赶上  是吧
I guess I'm too late, huh?

264
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,940
不  她还没走
No, she's still here.

265
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,140
在哪
Where?

266
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,250
金
Kim.

267
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,940
我非常  非常抱歉
I am so, so sorry.

268
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,050
我昨晚就应该告诉你的
I should have told you last night.

269
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,370
是吗
You think?

270
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,530
我真以为我能解决的
I honestly thought I could fix it.

271
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,280
我以为他们一看到数字就懂了
I thought they'd understand once they saw the numbers.

272
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,420
我知道广告会有用  也确实如此
I knew it would work, and it did.

273
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,840
真的有效
It worked.

274
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,030
霍华德不能因为我做的事
Howard can't just stick you in doc review

275
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,460
就把你弄来复审文件
because of something I did.

276
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,240
而且我俩在两家不同的律所
Plus, at an ‭entirely different law firm.

277
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,530
完全没有道理啊
What the hell kind of sense does that make?!

278
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,130
我告诉过你后果就是这样
I told you this would happen.

279
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,470
他不能因为这事怪你
He can't blame you for this.

280
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,920
我警告过你他会的
I warned you he would.

281
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,250
我要去找霍华德
I'm talking to Howard.

282
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,680
干什么  再骂他是卑鄙无耻的猪吗
What? And call him a pig fucker again?

283
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,310
是啊  会有用的
Yeah, that'll help.

284
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,710
我搞砸了
I screwed up, you know?

285
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,840
我知道
I know that.

286
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,530
但这...  这完全是扯淡
But this -- this is total B.S.!

287
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,190
我今晚就去找他谈
I'm -- ‭I'm talking to him tonight!

288
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,480
吉米别去  你只会弄得更糟
Jimmy, no. ‭You'd only make things worse.

289
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,430
-我会向他解释  -不用
- I'll explain it to him. - ‭No!

290
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,550
我不是请求你  而是告诉你
I'm not asking you -- I'm telling you.

291
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,890
如果你去找霍华德  你和我就没戏了
If you go to Howard, you and I -- we're done.

292
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,080
那我们现在还有戏吗
So, we're not done now?

293
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,920
我需要这份工作
I need this job.

294
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,730
我还有大约四十个小时的收费指标没完成
And there's a weekly billing quota that I'm about 40 hours behind on,

295
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,180
所以可以请你离开吗
so could you please just go?

296
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,880
对不起
I'm sorry.

297

I'm not going away!

301

好  你自找的
All right, you asked for it!

302
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,360
我进来了
I'm comin' in!

303
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,840

Can you hear me?

能说话吗
Can you talk to me?

307

要我送你去医院吗
Do you want me ‭to get you to the hospital?

308
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,170
不  不去医院
No. No hospitals.

309
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,170
我会好的
I'll -- I'll be all right.

310
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,070

给你额外的保护
Extra protection here.

坐起来
Sit up.

314
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,930
你能坐起来吗
Can you sit?

315
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,450
好的

这是阿玛利特AR-50狙击步枪
That's the Armalite AR-50 --

制造技术先进  精确范围两千四百米
State of the art, ‭accurate to 2,400 meters.

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,010
装备了里奥波特Mark4瞄准镜
I got the Leupold Mark 4 on it now,

321
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,700
但我可以帮你升级到施密特本德的
but I can always upgrade you to a Schmidt & Bender.

322
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,380
手动单发
Single shot, bolt.

323
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,120
简单  有效  值得信赖
Simple, effective, reliable.

324
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,780
用的是0.50直径的子弹
It fires the .50-caliber BMG --

325
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,200
对轻型掩体内的软目标很有效
Very effective against soft targets in light cover --

326
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,140
可以射穿汽车  小树等等
behind cars, ‭small-diameter trees, and such.

327
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,240
与往常一样  我已经特意
As always, I've gone to the trouble

328
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,290
磨掉了序列号
of grinding down the serial number.

329
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,820
除非你彻底磨个洞
Well, unless you ‭ground a hole clean through,

330
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,410
否则用酸都可以复原
acid will recover it.

331
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,710
说得没错
Well, that would be true,

332
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,880
但我又用随机点刻压力机做了处理
but I follow up with a pass through ‭a random-stipple machine press.

333
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,430
把它藏在金属密度中
Hides the patterns in the metal density.

334
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,710
应该可以逃过X射线衍射
Should throw off your X-ray diffraction

335
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,930
还有其他高科技手段的检测
and some other higher-end methods.

336
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,950
当然万事无完美  但这枪接近完美了
Nothing's perfect, of course, but this is close.

337
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,460
就像疝气上装了个瞄准镜
Looks like a hernia with a scope on it.

338
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,300
三十四磅
34 pounds,

339
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,430
不包括你的枪架  那也会增加重量
not including your bipod, which adds some heft.

340
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,340
太重了
Too much gun.

341
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,090
我同意  对于大多数场合确实重
For most applications, I would tend to agree.

342
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,660
SR-25比赛步枪  尤金·斯通勒设计  半自动
SR-25 match rifle -- Eugene Stoner design, semi-auto.

343
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,850
大概十一磅
That's about 11 pounds there.

344
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,370
没有AR-50的射程和穿透力
Not quite the range or the punch of the AR-50,

345
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,570
但射程就算超过一千米
but you're still talking about a .5 M.O.A.

346
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,580
射击精度也高达0.5MOA
at well past 1,000 meters.

347
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,220
我听说容易卡壳
I've heard they're prone to jam.

348
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,040
在实战中确实发生过
Well, it's been known to happen in the field,

349
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,950
但没有一把半自动步枪可以自吹不卡壳的
but there's not a semi-auto built can boast it never jams.

350
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,190
如果你有所顾虑  你应该选择手动式的
If that's a concern, you ought to stick to bolts.

351
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,190
好的手动步枪如果都能卡壳
Good bolt-action rifle -- if you jammed it,

352
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,550
那我打赌你肯定是故意的
I'd wager ‭you were setting out to do so.

353
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,870
我们来看看这把M40
Which brings us to the M40 --

354
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,470
十分可靠  经过战斗检验
Tried and true, battle-tested.

355
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,050
自从1966年
Essentially, the same rifle

356
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,340
海军陆战队狙击手就用这种枪了
used by marine snipers since 1966.

357
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,100
轻便精准  适合在八百到一千二百米之内
It's light, accurate, good for soft targets

358
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,220
射击软目标
in the 800- to 1,2000-meter range.

359
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,670
看起来你了解这把枪
You seem to know this one.

360
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,790
那当然
Oh, yeah.

361
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,890
可以这么说
You could say that.

362
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,850
那是A1型
That's the A1 model.

363
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,040
在原版基础上变化不大
There's not much change from the original.

364
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,580
最大的不同在于枪托
Biggest difference is the stock --

365
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,730
不是木制的  改成玻璃纤维了
it's fiberglass instead of wood.

366
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,320
1970年左右改的
It changed it over in 1970 or so.

367
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,380
好的  木头太容易变形
Good. Wood warped like hell.

368
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,820
要是受了潮  又被曝晒  就完了
You get it wet, ‭you put it in the sun -- gone.

369
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,350
这枪被带到该死的丛林里使用之前
Somebody probably ‭should've figured that out

370
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,930
那些人真该想到这点
before they sent it into a damn jungle.

371
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,750
是应该想到
Yeah. Probably.

372
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,930
如果这些都不喜欢
If these aren't to your liking,

373
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,940
我可以再弄几支来
I could get my hands on a few more.

374
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,030
不用了
No.

375
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,630
我改主意了
I've changed my mind.

376
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,410
谢谢
Thank you.

377
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,450
这次我不需要枪
I don't need anything at this time.

378
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,590
麻烦你了
For your trouble.

379
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,980
不用客气
Oh, it's no trouble.

380
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,540
我做的都是回头生意
I make my living on repeat business.

381
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,690
等你有需要  就来找我
When you need what I'm offering, you know how to find me.

382
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,820
你还在这啊
You're still here.

383
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,390
是的  我还在
Yeah, I'm still here.

384
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,500
你睡觉了吗
Did you get any sleep?

385
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,190
睡了一会
Some.

386
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,640
足够了
Enough.

387
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,840
你感觉怎么样
‭How you feeling?

388
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,720
我想喝点茶
I could use some tea.

389
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,400
谢谢
Thanks.

390
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,240
你昨晚吓到我了
‭You scared me last night.

391
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,690
是啊  有时候会这样
Yeah. Happens sometimes.

392
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,750
有时候是我太过火了  仅此而已
Sometimes, I overdo it -- that's all.

393
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,300
都会好的
It passes.

394
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,390
去办公室把你累得筋疲力竭吧
Going into the office really takes it out of you, doesn't it?

395
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,360
如果待得太久  是很累
If I stay too long, yeah.

396
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,060
大概是走不开吧
Guess it's hard not to stay.

397
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,740
毕竟有那么多重要的事要你来做
There's so many important things for you to do there --

398
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,170
比如惩罚金·韦克斯勒
like, you know, stick it to Kim Wexler.

399
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,310
我对金·韦克斯勒做什么了
What did I do to Kim Wexler?

400
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,950
她又回"玉米地"了  不是吗
She's back in the cornfield, isn't she?

401
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,860
我什么都没对金做
I didn't do anything to Kim.

402
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,100
我当时确实在场
I mean, I was present, yes.

403
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,630
但是人事管理的决策都是霍华德做的
But management of personnel -- those decisions are all Howard's.

404
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,860
可笑
That is rich.

405
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:23,650
那你告诉我
But tell me,

406
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,020
霍华德做"管理决策"的时候
when Howard was makin' his "management decisions,"

407
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,220
是坐在你膝盖上  你把手伸进他屁眼了吗
was he sitting on your knee with your arm up his ass?

408
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,860
把霍华德比作戴在手上的布偶

409
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,860
你喝水的时候他是不是都说不出话
Hey, can he talk while you drink a glass of water?

410
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,460
你简直没有道理
That's uncalled-for.

411
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,100
如果霍华德是我的布偶
And if howard were my puppet,

412
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,030
他才不会推荐你去戴维斯梅因律所
he certainly wouldn't have recommended you to Davis & Main.

413
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,790
实际上  我确定是金·韦克斯勒
Actually, I'm sure it was Kim Wexler

414
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,530
说服他这样做的  所以他才生气
who talked him into doing that. Hence his anger.

415
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,190
别惩罚金
Don't punish Kim.

416
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,620
如果你生我的气  那就冲我来
If you're mad at me, take it out on me.

417
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,370
你觉得整个世界都围着你转  吉米
I know you like to think the world revolves around you, Jimmy,

418
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,400
但这和你无关
but this has nothing to do with you.

419
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,600
金对哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所负责
Kim had a responsibility to Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill.

420
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,020
她本该为自己律所的利益着想
She should have been looking out for her firm's interests.

421
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,710
没告诉我们你要干什么是她的错
Not letting us know what you were up to was her mistake.

422
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,530
拜托
Oh, come on.

423
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,850
你不能为这事生她的气
You can't be pissed off at her about this.

424
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,190
我没生气
I'm not.

425
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,450
霍华德才生气
Howard is.

426
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,370
他凭什么不生气呢
And why shouldn't he be?

427
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,590
因为她不知道
Because she didn't know.

428
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,680
她不知道我会播出广告
She didn't know I was gonna air the commercial.

429
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,440
也不知道我还没得到许可
She didn't know ‭i hadn't gotten it approved.

430
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,310
她不知道
She just -- she didn't know.

431
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,520
-我懂了  -所以她不知道
- I see. - So, she didn't know

432
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,590
她应该事先通知霍华德什么
there was anything that she was supposed to tell Howard.

433
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,370
她以为克利福德已经知情了
As far as she was concerned, Cliff Main was already looped in.

434
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,690
你跟她说他知道了
You told her he was?

435
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,780
我是这么暗示的
I implied it.

436
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,770
所以错在我  不在她
So it's on me, not her.

437
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,460
她没跟我们说这些啊
She didn't say anything to us about that.

438
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,610
她不会说的
Well, she wouldn't.

439
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,310
她不想让我出丑
Sh-she wouldn't want to make me look bad.

440
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,730
你不能否认  这说明她缺乏判断
You have to admit this shows a lack of judgment on her part.

441
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,690
她了解你
She knows you.

442
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,870
她应该采取正确的做法
She should have known better.

443
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,780
你真是个混蛋
You are such an asshole.

444
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,590
我怎么了
Why?

445
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,280
我不就是指出  她信任你是个错误吗
For pointing out that her one mistake was believing in you?

446
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,160
天啊  能不能正确看待这件事
For Christ's sake, can we get some perspective here?

447
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,940
这只是个小广告
It was a simple, little commercial.

448
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,810
只播出了一次  仅此而已
It aired once -- that's all.

449
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,350
要不要我提醒你  它非常有效
And can I remind you -- it worked.

450
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,150
效果惊人得好
It worked like a dream.

451
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,540
看到你的问题了吧  吉米
See, that's your problem, Jimmy --

452
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,330
你认为只要结果好  手段都不重要
thinking the ends justify the means.

453
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,280
坏事了以后你又总是觉得震惊
And you're forever shocked when it all blows up in your face.

454
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,290
我犯了什么不得了的大错
What did I do that was so wrong?

455
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,710
你坏了规矩
you broke the rules.

456
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,180
你让金变成了你的从犯
‭You turned Kim into your accessory.

457
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,620
你让霍华德难堪  可怜的人啊
You embarrassed Howard, who -- god help him --

458
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,280
他居然莫名其妙地在克利福德面前为你担保
inexplicably vouched for you with Cliff Main!

459
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,390
克利福德和他的合伙人被你弄得像蠢货
You made Cliff and his partners look like schmucks!

460
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,740
还要我继续说吗
Shall I go on?!

461
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,940
我简直搞不懂他为什么还没炒了你
How he hasn't fired you for this positively mystifies me.

462
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,200
还"正确看待"
"Perspective."

463
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,340
你要正确地看待吗
You want perspective?

464
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,630
那我给你说
I'll give you mine --

465
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,740
你是我弟弟  我很爱你
you're my brother and I love you,

466
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,670
但是你就像个酒鬼
but you're like an alcoholic

467
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,200
拒绝承认自己有毛病
who refuses to admit he's got a problem.

468
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,650
现在有人给了你校车的钥匙
Now someone's given you the keys to the school bus,

469
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,980
我才不会让你把它开下悬崖
and I'm not gonna let you drive it off a cliff!

470
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,710
我们能直接说要点吗
Now, can we just get down to brass tacks here?

471
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,900
我要做什么才能让金回到原来岗位
What can I do to put Kim back where she belongs, huh?

472
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,350
你希望我退出戴维斯梅因律所吗
What -- you want me to quit Davis & Main?

473
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,140
那好
That's fine.

474
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,280
我当初就没想要那份工作
I-I never wanted that job in the first place.

475
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,510
跟你说不清楚
I can't get through to you.

476
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,930
生活不是《做交易》的那种游戏
Life is not one big game of "Let's Make a Deal"!

477
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,180
就是  我是蒙蒂·霍尔
Yes, it is! ‭I'm Monty Hall!

478
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,180
一档游戏节目  蒙蒂·霍尔曾担任主持人

479
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,590
二号门后面是什么
What's behind door number two?

480
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,230
有什么代价
What'll it take, huh?!

481
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,490
你想让我退出律师行业吗
You want me to quit being a lawyer?

482
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,800
像猩猩拿着一把机关枪
Ju-- a chimp with a machine gun --

483
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,960
说的是我  对吧
That's me, right, huh?!

484
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,300
你觉得呢
So, what do you say?

485
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,550
你帮金  我不当律师了
You help Kim -- I quit the law.

486
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,820
-成交吗  -我没那么说
- Is that a deal? - ‭I didn't say that.

487
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:35,930
你嘴上没说  但心里却这么想  是吧
No, you didn't say it, but that's what you want, right?!

488
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,150
所以你当初才强迫她
That's why you put the screws to Kim in the first place --

489
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,130
为了逼我
to squeeze me!

490
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,700
我没那么说  我也不会那么说
I didn't say that, ‭and I would never say that!

491
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,710
为什么
Why not?!

492
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,520
因为如果我阻碍我一个雇员的职业道路
Because if I were impeding the career of one of my employees

493
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,440
是为了逼你做你不愿意做的事
for the purpose of compelling you to do something against your will,

494
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,010
那就是敲诈
that would be extortion.

495
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:51,790
没错
Yeah. ‭

496
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,880
就是  那么
It would. So?

497
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,180
你要敲诈我吗  查克
You gonna extort me, Chuck?

498
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,320
那你肯定能轻而易举脱罪
It's a lead-pipe cinch you'd get away with it.

499
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,990
我不会告诉任何人
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

500
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,650
很简单  只要恢复金的职位
It's real easy -- you just set things right for Kim.

501
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,690
让她回原来的办公室  不再复审文件
You get her back in her office, out of doc review --

502
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,850
一切回归原样  我永远不当律师了
Everything back to normal, and I quit the law for good.

503
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,380
不再有吉米·麦吉尔先生  没了
No more Jimmy McGill, esquire -- poof!

504
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,050
就像没存在过
Like he never even existed.

505
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,310
但我得听你亲口说出来  行吗
But I need to hear the words come out of your mouth, okay?

506
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,230
你言而有信
‭You're a man of your word.

507
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,890
你是诚实的人  对吧
You're an upstanding man, right?

508
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,130
-天啊  吉米  -快说  查克
- For god's sake, Jimmy. ‭- Come on, chuck!

509
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,000
敲诈我
Extort me!

510
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,200
说"别干"  我就不干了
Say "quit," and I will quit,

511
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,940
但我得听你亲口说
but I need to hear it from your mouth!

512
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,590
你想让我犯下重罪吗
You want me to commit a felony...

513
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,670
这才是你的目的  对吧
Because that's what you'd do, right?

514
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,670
因为你想要相信  我其实是个伪君子
Because you want to believe that deep down, I'm some hypocrite!

515
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,100
那就来看看你是不是
Let's find out.

516
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,410
来吧  查克
Come on down, Chuck!

517
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,390
跟我一起在地上打滚吧
Roll around in the dirt with me!

518
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,730
你会实现所有的梦想
All your dreams will come true!

519
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,220
来  快  快说
Go on! Do it! Go on!

520
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,590
我不是坏人
I am not the bad guy here.

521
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,710
你不想当律师
You don't want to be a lawyer --

522
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,490
那是你和新墨西哥州律师协会的事
that's between you ‭and the New Mexico State Bar.

523
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,180
你想离开戴维斯梅因律所  随便你
You want to quit Davis & Main? Be my guest!

524
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,670
你想毁掉前途显然不需要我的帮助
You clearly don't need any help from me to tank your career.

525
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,440
你自己犯的事足矣
You're doing just fine on your own.

526
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,190
说到自毁前途  去圣达菲要一小时车程
Speaking of which, it's an hour's drive to Santa Fe.

527
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,150
就算你现在走
Even if you leave right now,

528
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,150
上班还得迟到至少二十分钟
you're still gonna be at least 20 minutes late for work --

529
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,510
克利福德·梅因对你的印象会更坏
another feather in your cap with Clifford Main.

530
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,540
怎么样
So?

531
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,800
我不干了
I'm not gonna do it.

532
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,560
怎么  你想谈判吗
What -- ‭are you negotiating now?

533
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,070
钱再多这也是个馊主意  对你来说
No amount of money makes this a good idea -- for you.

534
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,080
听着  伙计  我说了我没...
Look, man, ‭I told you that I'm not --

535
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,970
这样不好  因为解决不了你的实际问题
No, it's a bad move because it doesn't solve your real problem.

536
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,530
实际问题是什么
My real problem? What's that?

537
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,260
不是屠库
It's not Tuco.

538
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,170
而是保密
It's keeping a secret.

539
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,130
屠库的死会把塞拉曼加的人像苍蝇一样引来
A dead Tuco ‭draws Salamancas like flies.

540
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,780
贩毒集团会打探此事
The cartel noses into the business,

541
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,450
寻找杀害同伙的人
looks for who hit one of theirs.

542
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,990
你那时还能保密吗
You gonna be able to keep your secrets then?

543
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,670
总要付出代价
Something's got to give.

544
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,750
有没有你  我无所谓
With you, without you -- I don't care.

545
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,470
总会发生的
But something's gonna happen.

546
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,430
你自己也说了
You said it yourself.

547
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,670
你不需要他死  你需要他离开
You don't need him dead -- you need him to go away.

548
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,110
你是说告密吗
You mean snitch?

549
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,330
我打了屠库的小报告
Man, I drop a dime on Tuco,

550
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,010
你觉得集团会怀疑谁
who do you think the cartel looks at?

551
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,760
我
Me.

552
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,390
如果报警  我也会被抓
And if I call the cops, I get picked up, too.

553
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,840
我就成了已知关联人
I'm what you call a known associate.

554
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,690
他们把我跟屠库关在一起
So I'm locked up with Tuco,

555
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,490
而他正在找让他被关起来的人
who's looking for the guy that put him there.

556
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:45,870
告诉我那怎么能帮我
Tell me how that helps me.

557
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,830
你不用跟警察说
You won't have to talk to the cops.

558
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,300
任何时候都不用
You won't have to do any time.

559
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,210
不会死人  但屠库的问题
There's no killing, but your Tuco problem?

560
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,500
会解决的
It goes away.

561
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,990
都在这儿了
It's all there.

562
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,510
让他点点
Let the man count.

563
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,490
没问题
We're good.

564
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,160
那...下次再见
So, uh... till next time, huh?

565
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,140
屠库
Tuco.

566
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,030
行
Okay.

567
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,060
走
Go.

568
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,160
行
Okay.

569
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,840
下周再见  屠库
I'll, uh... ‭I'll see you next week, Tuco.

570
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,140
纳乔
Nacho.

571
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,480
再见  多明戈
Yeah, see you, Domingo.

572
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,140
他给钱还挺多
He's got good numbers.

573
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,190
挺拼命的
He's hustlin'.

574
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,470
你觉得呢
What do you think?

575
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,390
可靠吗
Solid?

576
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,590
电话

577
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,930
没错  我想报告一起冲突
Uh, uh, y-yes, I would like to report a fight going on

578
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,240
发生在伊斯莱塔大道五千街区的
at the El Michoacano restaurant in the 5000 block of

579
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,430
米却肯饭店
the Isleta Boulevard.

580
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,640
有个男人用枪威胁另一个男人
There's a man threatening another man with a gun.

581
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,530
看着像黑帮闹事
It looks to be some sort of gang thing.

582
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,350
抱歉
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sorry.

583
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,540
我  我只是个过路的
I-I -- I'm a passerby.

584
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,680
我可不想卷进去
I-I don't want to get involved.

585
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,450
他妈的
The fuck.

586
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,170
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

587
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:54,740
看到什么
See what?

588
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,530
那个老头撞了我的车
That old man just hit my car.

589
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,360
你好
Hello. Oh. Hmm.

590
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,750

Well, let me see.

我要四号餐和鸡块  麻烦你了
Give me the number four, the pollo, por favor.

看到停在你那破车旁边的那辆车了吗
You see that car that you parked your piece of shit next to?

601
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,900
是我的
That's mine.

You just ran into it.

不  我想我没有
No, I don't think I did.

604
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,470
那你是说我撒谎了
You calling me a liar?

605
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,890
我没这么说
Uh, no.

我也看到了
Hey. I saw it, too.

607

你打算否认吗
You gonna stand here and deny it?

608
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,590
小伙子们  我不知道该怎么跟你们说
Um, guys, um, I-I don't know what to tell you.

我不知道我撞了谁的车
I'm not aware ‭of hitting anyone's car,

但如果我真撞到了  那我道歉
but if I did... I apologize.

谢谢
Thank you.

不好意思
Excuse me.

你给我站住
Don't you walk away from me.

616

老头  你最好听他的话
Hey, pops. You better listen to the man.

说重点
