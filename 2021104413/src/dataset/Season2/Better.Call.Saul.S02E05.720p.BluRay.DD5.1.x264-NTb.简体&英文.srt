Not at all.

排练得如何
How was rehearsal?

24
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,010
那女的有好好表现吗
Did what's-her-name behave herself?

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,630
她觉得整个章节都是她的似的
She takes the whole section for granted.

26
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,620
我还在纠结要不要跟她说
I'm debating ‭whether to say something.

你该说出来  真的
I think you should, absolutely.

28

毕竟  如果她影响了整个表演...
And after all, if she's compromising the work...

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,870
这很难说
Mm. Well, it's debatable.

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,400
舒伯特那部分还不错
I mean, the Schubert is coming along nicely.

34
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,400
主要是士气的问题
It's more about morale.

35
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,280
士气会影响质量
Morale can affect quality.

没什么大不了的
Please. It's no big deal.

00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,460
我看到个柠檬的好像还挺好吃
Well, I found a citrus one that looked good,

所以我想试试
so I thought I would try that.

43
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,010
总之  你是个勤劳且毫无怨言的人
Well, anyway, you are a trouper.

44

你做这个动作  我就会说我还要读报告
You do this, and I'll say I have briefs to read,

53

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,520
-等等  我也想起来一个  -快说
- Wait. I think I know one. - Oh, bring it on.

171
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,290
好啊
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,560
律师和精子的共同点是什么
Um, what do lawyers and sperm have in common?

173
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,180
这个
Oh, just... ‭Um.

174
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,440
三百万  不不
3 million -- no, wait.

175
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,430
三百万分之一
Um, 1 in 3 million...

176
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,710
-有机会成为人类  -有机会成为人类
- have a chance ‭of becoming a human being. - Of becoming a human being.

177
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,760
这个我喜欢
Love that one.

178
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,960
晚餐还不错  你觉得呢
Well, that went well, don't you think?

179
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,910
当然  还是要谢谢你
Sure. Thanks again.

180
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,490
我不知道你在担心什么
I don't know ‭what you were worried about.

181
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,730
吉米挺好的
Jimmy's great.

182
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,610
是挺好的  不  他有点
Yeah. No, he's...

183
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,760
没什么
Yeah.

184
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,110
明天要做什么
So, what's going on tomorrow?

185
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,990
十点要帮戈恩斯泰特作证词
Well, I've got the ‭Gernstetter deposition at 10:00,

186
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,040
午饭后要连开几场合伙人会议
Back-to-back partner meetings after lunch.

187
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,340
应该不会太晚
It shouldn't be a late one.

188
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,760
那女的事情你想得怎么样了
Thought any more about what's-her-name?

189
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,090
那也关系到你的名声  不是吗
It's your reputation, too, you know?

190
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,970
我们周一先从柴可夫斯基开始
Well, we start the Tchaikovsky on monday,

191
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,190
我看看结束时她的状态怎么样
so I'll see what kind of mood she's in when we wrap.

192
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,110
聪明
Smart.

193
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,820
二十五个律师被水泥埋到下巴了  你该说什么
What do you call 25 attorneys buried up to their chins in cement?

194
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,830
-水泥还不够  -什么
- Not enough cement. - ‭What?

196
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,790
绝命律师
第二季 第五集

197
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:56,690
詹姆斯·麦吉尔

198
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,560
你好  这是金·韦克斯勒的语音信箱
Hello. You've reached the voicemail of Kim Wexler.

199
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,510
请留言
Please leave me a message,

200
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,210
我会尽快回复你
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

201
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,970
又是我
It's me again.

202
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,240
我想到了一个方法能帮你摆脱那里
Look, I think I found something that could help get you outta there.

203
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,740
我会弥补这一切的
I'm gonna make things right.

204
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,350
给我回个电话吧
Call me, would you?

205
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,130
你好
Hi.

206
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,440
抱歉  我没打算吓你一跳
Sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

207
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,990
-我以为大家都走了  -没有
- I just thought everyone was gone. ‭- Nope.

208
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,330
我一般都待到很晚
I'm here late most nights.

209
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,400
顺便提一句  我在你办公室看到...
By the way, I noticed in your office...

210
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,840
你扔掉了一个易拉罐
You threw away a soda can.

211
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,980
你翻了我的垃圾
You're going through my trash?

212
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,750
没有
No.

213
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,970
我只是午休时进去送文件
I was just dropping off papers at lunchtime,

214
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,850
无意中看到它在你的垃圾筒里
and I happened to notice it in your trash can.

215
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,620
我把它拿出来了  没事了
I fished it out, so it's fine.

216
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,590
办公室的垃圾筒是扔可回收纸张的
Office cans ‭are for recyclable paper --

217
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,730
厨房里有个单独的大垃圾桶用来放塑料
there's a separate big can in the kitchen for plastic,

218
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,020
玻璃和铝金属
glass, and aluminum.

219
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,370
我们这里十分重视生态足迹
We take our ecological footprint pretty seriously here.

220
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,830
好吧  也就是说
okay, so, the big can

221
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,520
大垃圾桶是扔我的威士忌酒瓶的地方
is where I should throw my empty Scotch bottles.

222
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,250
我明白的
No, I-I get it.

223
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,630
绿色生活
Go green.

224
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,880
好了  还有别的事吗
Good. Was there anything else?

225
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,810
是的  还有一件小事
Yeah, one quick thing.

226
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,830
我这里有你早上给克利福德的简报
I have the brief you gave Cliff this morning --

227
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,070
原告对被告动议的反对
the plaintiff's opposition to the defendant's motion?

228
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,000
我做了几个批注
I have a few notes.

229
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,360
应该挺清楚了
I think they're pretty clear,

230
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,940
但如果我们能一起看一遍可能更好办点
but it's probably easier if we just go over them together.

231
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,300
天啊  那是克利福德的批注
Jesus. Th-those are Cliff's?

232
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,630
不  是我的批注
No, they're my notes.

233
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,760
如果你有时间  咱们现在就过一遍吧
I'd love go to over them now, if you have a minute.

234
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,090
其实没看上去这么糟
It looks worse than it is.

235
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,570
只是...我们有特有的版式
It's -- it's just that we have a particular house style.

236
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,440
无意冒犯
Okay, no offense,

237
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,840
不过  你是两年律师吧
But, uh, you're a second-year associate, right?

238
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,410
-是的  -我有四年了
- Yep. ‭- And I came in as a fourth-year.

239
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,320
没错
That's right.

240
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,580
那为什么一个两年员工要给四年员工做批注
So, why is a second-year giving notes to a fourth-year?

241
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,170
就像我说的  我清楚版式要求
Well, like I said, I know the house style.

242
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,330
是克利福德派你来当我保姆的吗
Does Cliff have you babysitting me?

243
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,180
不是
No.

244
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,910
这只是同事之间互相帮助
This is just one associate helping another.

245
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,300
比如这里  罗马数字标题
Like here, ‭the Roman numeral headings --

246
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,850
全都要大写
we use all caps for those.

247
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,330
你用的是缩进  这当然没问题
And you indented them, which is perfectly fine,

248
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,120
不过克利福德更喜欢居中
but Cliff likes them centered.

249
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,240
差点忘了
Oh, and before I forget,

250
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,790
所有文件中  在句号后面都要空两格
we put two spaces after a period on all our documents.

251
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,390
这的确不是什么大事
I know it seems like a minor thing,

252
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,080
但这样页面会整洁得多
but really looks so much cleaner on the page.

253
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,290
你所做的引述有点多
You went a tad overboard with the quotations.

254
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,190
引用主导性法律意见是没问题的
It's okay to present a quote from a controlling legal opinion,

255
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,530
但如果你引用过多
but when you use too many,

256
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,960
它会打乱你论述的节奏
it disrupts ‭the flow of your argument,

257
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,660
而且让人感觉
and it gives the impression

258
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,490
你没法独立论述
you don't know how to write an argument of your own.

259
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,140
你当然知道怎么写
‭And I'm sure you do, so...

260
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:28,810
你有过度使用"显然"  "无疑"之类词的倾向
‭You have a tendency to overuse the words "Clearly" and "Obviously."

261
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,050
这其实还是个人见解的问题...
Again, it's a matter of personal opinion --

262
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,170
我真的很感激  艾琳
I really appreciate this, Erin,

263
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,610
但是  我正打算走了
But, uh, ‭I was just on my way out.

264
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,170
我们能不能明天一早再继续讨论
So, if we could continue this first thing tomorrow morning...

265
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,380
我觉得我们应该现在就看完
Well, I was thinking we should just get 'er done now.

266
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,670
分秒必争啊
No time like the present.

267
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,140
当然
Sure.

268
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,890
让我们卷起袖子  大干一场吧
Let's roll up our sleeves and apply a little elbow grease.

269
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,600
太好了
Great!

270
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,470
我去拿我最喜欢的笔
So, I'm gonna get my favorite pen,

271
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,830
随即就去找你
and I will see you momentarily.

272
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,930
没问题
You got it.

273
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,650
韦克斯勒小姐
Uh, Miss Wexler?

274
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,490
你可以叫我金
You can call me Kim.

275
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,860
金  已经十一点四十了
Kim, it's 20 to midnight.

276
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,940
你在问能不能走吗
Are you asking me if you can leave?

277
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,820
伙计们  我又不是你们上司
Guys, I'm not your supervisor.

278
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,350
不用因为我留下来
Don't stick around on my account.

279
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,030
一起走吗  金
You coming, Kim?

280
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,370
随后就走
Right behind you.

281
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,690
只要完成最后这一份
Just finishing up this last one.

282
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,040
斯韦卡特和考科利

283
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,450
又打扰你了  谢了
Again, thanks.

284
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,480
杰苏阿尔多  你今晚可以不打扫吗
Hey, Gesualdo, could you skip vacuuming tonight, please?

285
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,970
就五分钟  就给我五分钟
Five minutes -- just give me five minutes.

286
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,020
这就是解决这场闹剧的方法
Here's how we're gonna handle this travesty of justice.

287
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,550
韦克斯勒诉哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
Wexler vs. Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill --

288
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,910
你想要我起诉我的公司吗
You want me to sue my own firm?

289
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,290
文件都打印好了  蓄势待发
Filing's all typed up. It's ready to go.

290
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,010
这不是我的专长
This is not my area of expertise, all right?

291
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,370
所以首先要做的
So, first order of business --

292
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,600
我们要找一个专门处理劳工法的律师
we get a great employment-law attorney.

293
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,240
让他们知道我们是认真的
Show 'em we mean business.

294
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,340
说真的
‭Come on.

295
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,780
你看看你
Hey, look at you. ‭

296
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,730
你半夜还在这看似荣耀实则监狱的地方
Okay, you're here at midnight in this glorified cellblock

297
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,700
努力工作  是为了什么
busting your ass -- for what?

298
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,400
跟你的表现一点关系也没有
It has nothing to do with your performance.

299
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,700
你受到了不公待遇
You're being mistreated.

300
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,560
查克是通过惩罚你来牵制我
Chuck is punishing you to get to me.

301
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,790
这是敲诈  简单明了
This is extortion, pure and simple.

302
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,330
不  是霍华德要维护形象
No, that's Howard, ‭who has an image to uphold.

303
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,300
凯特尔曼案惨败后他也这么做的
He did the same thing after the Kettleman fiasco,

304
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,360
查克也没有干预
and Chuck was nowhere in sight.

305
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,240
我告诉你  查克就是罪魁祸首
I'm telling you -- Chuck is behind this.

306
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,790
不  你才是罪魁祸首
No, you are behind this.

307
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,700
我告诉过你后果  现在我就在付出代价
I told you this would happen, and now I'm paying the price.

308
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,680
我要是早知道就好了
I shoulda known better.

309
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,900
现在我要保持低调  熬过去
So now I'm keeping my head down, and I'm getting through this.

310
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,200
而且我肯定不会起诉哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
And I'm most certainly not suing HHM.

311
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,330
-金  -就算我胜诉了  谁还会雇佣我
- Kim - Even if I won, who would hire me?

312
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,740
那是自断前程的行为
That would be career suicide.

313
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,920
好吧
All right.

314
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,950
那我退出戴维斯梅因律所
Then I quit Davis & Main.

315
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,470
那有什么用
What does that accomplish?

316
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,980
这是唯一可以让你脱离困境的方法
It's the only way to get you outta dutch

317
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,530
因为这和查克有关
because this is about Chuck,

318
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,160

The worst part --

糟了  我得走了
Ah, damn it. I gotta run.

490
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,110
我要去处理几个白痴...
I'm putting away ‭some brain-dead suck wad...

Kevin, true story -- when I was 7 years old,

548
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,770
我的第一个银行账户就在梅萨维德银行
my very first bank account was at Mesa Verde,

549
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,780
你能相信吗
if you ‭can believe it.

550
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,110
我信  我也是  那时我爸还负责经营呢
I can. Mine was, too, back when my dad ran the place.

551
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,990
我记得我第一本存折的封面
I can remember ‭the cover of my first passbook.

552
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,960
-是剪影...  -牛仔的剪影
- It was a silhouette of a... - Cowboy.

553
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,260
马背上的牛仔  站在仙人掌旁边
Cowboy on horseback, yes, standing next to a cactus.

554
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,950
我喜欢那牛仔
I loved that cowboy.

555
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,410
我那时一直在为买下那匹马攒钱
Far as I was concerned, I was saving up for that horse.

556
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,530
不然钱对于一个七岁小孩来说又有什么用呢
What the heck else is money good for when you're 7 years old?

557
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,610
我们在会议室中为你准备了
So, we have ‭a little presentation for you

558

一次小小的展示  还准备了零食

559
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,620

571
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,630
或者列个清单  看看派哪些律师去处理
Maybe...put together a list of staff associates we can put on this.

572
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,130
让法兰西斯做吧
I'll put Francis on that.

573
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,940

Not at all. Come in.

577
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,550
我听见叮当声了
I hear clinking.

578
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,930
我们要庆祝什么吗
Does that mean ‭we have something to celebrate?

579
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,850
当然了
We sure do.

580
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,870
我们要庆祝什么
What are we drinking to?

581
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,400
给你弄了个肥差
Got a juicy one for you.

582
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,040
-梅萨维德银行  -预付聘金
- Mesa Verde? - ‭On retainer.

583
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,370
那更好了
Oh, even better.

584
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,690
恭喜
Congratulations.

585
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,720
是你在高尔夫球场上争取到的吗
One of your golf-course conquests?

586
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,660
金·韦克斯勒带来的
Kim Wexler brought them in.

587
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,500
一个四年律师争取到了二十五万的活儿
Fourth-year associate snags a quarter of a million in billings?

588
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,060
她自己可能也在喝酒庆祝呢
She's probably having a couple of drinks herself.

589
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,310
我猜  她应该再次受到重用吧
She's out of the doghouse, I assume?

590
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,880
再说吧
We'll see.

591
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,580
跨州扩张  这案子很复杂
Interstate expansion -- it's a complex case.

592
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,410
我们可能要对付两个  甚至三个监管委员会
That's two, maybe three regulatory commissions we'll be dealing with

593
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,670
律所可能得忙上几个月  甚至几年
Months of work for HHM, maybe years.

594

603
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,270
我来这一直工作到早九点
I'm coming in, working until 9:00.

604
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,630
律所开门之前办公更容易
It's easier before the place opens,

605
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,710
灯还没亮  电话也不会响个不停
without all the lights and the phones ringing.

606
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,100
想喝点咖啡吗
How about some coffee?

对不起
I apologize.

610
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,550
我没法自己做
It's just I-I can't do it myself,

611
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,390
我不能碰电器
what with the electricity.

612
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,340
-好  -不加糖
- Sure. ‭- No sugar.

613
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,210
稍微加点豆奶
Just a splash of soy milk.

614
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,430
应该有
I think we have it.

615
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,970
金
Kim?

616
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,010
泡两杯
Um, make two cups.

617
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,610
他们应该说得对
Well, I guess it's true what they say --

618
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:27,020
早起的鸟儿有虫吃  如果你喜欢虫子的话
The early bird gets the worm, which is good if you like worms.

619
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,600
我能问个问题吗
May I ask you a question?

620
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,740
当然
Of course.

621
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,170
我在这家律所有前途吗
Do I have a future at this firm?

622
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,440
你我有很多共同点
We have a lot in common, you and I.

623
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,700
我弟弟让你独自承担责任
My brother left you holding the bag.

624
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,480
要知道
If it makes you feel any better,

625
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,510
你不是第一个为他担风险的人
you're not the first person to go out on a limb for him.

626
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,640
我总是反复犯同样的错误
I made the same mistake over and over again.

627
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,960
结果现在霍华德也犯了
And now Howard has...

628
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,290
他怨你
And he blames you.

629
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,900
真是一团乱
It's a damned mess.

630
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,190
吉米跟你说过我们的爸爸的事吗
Jimmy ever tell you anything about our father?

631
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,580
没怎么说过
Not much, no.

632
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,730
我爸爸  我们的爸爸  他是
My dad -- our dad -- he was --

633
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,210
典型的好人
well... the personification of good.

634
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,020
我都不知道他能不能看见任何罪恶
I'm not sure he could even see sin in any form,

635
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,170
他似乎就没这个基因
like he was born without the gene.

636
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,740
他在西塞罗市经营一家街角小店
He ran a little corner store in Cicero --

637
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,270
卖卖烟草  散装糖果
cigarettes behind the counter, penny candy --

638
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,810
没什么特别的  但是能维持家用
nothing special, ‭but it kept food on the table.

639
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,380
邻居们都很喜欢他
And the neighborhood loved dad.

640
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,990
他叫得出每个人的名字  了解他们的生活
He knew everybody's name, what was going on in their lives.

641
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,510
他让这个小小的拐角变得更好
This little corner -- he made it better.

642
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,380
我是以他的名字命名的
I was named after him.

643
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,700
在那之前  他在很多人手下工作过
Before that, he'd worked for a lot of people over the years,

644
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,410
他的梦想就是自己当老板
and his dream was to be his own boss --

645
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,500
倾其所有开了这个小店
put everything he had into that place.

646
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,860
他让吉米在店里干活儿的时候我在外面上大学
I was away at college when he put Jimmy to work there.

647
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,510
吉米从小就在店里  看着爸爸长大
Jimmy grew up in that store, watching our father.

648
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,380
但我爸不善经营
But dad was not the world's greatest businessman,

649
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,840
最终资金周转不灵
and eventually, ‭he ran into money troubles.

650
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,020
那时候我在当法庭书记员
I, um, ‭had a clerkship at the time,

651
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,340
但我还是回家去帮他理清账目
but I came home to help him get his books in order,

652
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,750
解决问题
set the ship straight.

653
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,650
我不是会计
Now, I'm no accountant,

654
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:50,630
可我还是发现少了一万四千块
but I discovered $14,000 was just gone.

655
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,900
就在这些年里无缘无故消失了
Vanished over the years.

656
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,280
结果是吉米陆陆续续偷的
Turns out Jimmy had pilfered it in dribs and drabs --

657
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,730
直接从收银台拿的
just took it out of the till.

658
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,380
我爸听不进去
My dad wouldn't hear it.

659
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,420
不可能  不是他的吉米干的
Nope. Not his Jimmy.

660
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,630
最后他只能卖了那小店
He ended up having to sell.

661
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,160
半年后  他去世了
Six months later, he was dead.

662
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,810
葬礼上  吉米哭得撕心裂肺
At the funeral, ‭no one cried harder than Jimmy.

663
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,070
我弟弟不是坏人
My brother is not a bad person.

664
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,620
他本性善良
He has a good heart.

665
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,430
只是
It's just...

666
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,110
他控制不住自己
...he can't help himself.

667
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,110
所以只能大家帮他收拾烂摊子
And everyone's left picking up the pieces.

668
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,080
还有咖啡吗
Is there any coffee left?

669
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,770
不  我来吧
No, I got it.

670
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,440
我会跟霍华德谈谈
I'll talk to Howard,

671
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,070
帮你们调解调解
pour a little oil on troubled waters.

672
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,710
让你在下面复审文件太大材小用了
You're being wasted down in doc review.

673
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,420
梅萨维德银行的业务拉得好
Good job with Mesa Verde.

674
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,280
请进  正在营业  今天没活  回家睡觉

675
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,110
我能坐这吗
Mind if I join you?

676
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,310
你好
Hi.

677
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,580
需要点什么吗
What can I get you?

678
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,240
咖啡  清咖
Coffee -- black.

679
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,150
马上就来
Coming right up.

680
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,100
他是把你揍得挺惨的
He really did a number on you.

681
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,400
抱歉  我认识你吗
Sorry. I know you?

682
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,330
打你的那个年轻人
The young man who did that to you.

683
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,420
他是我侄子  一直都这么莽撞
He's my nephew -- ‭hothead, always has been.

684
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,500
以为自己是个拳击手
Kid thinks he's a boxer.

685
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,740
他应该尊重你
He should have shown you respect.

686
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:39,390
我代表我们全家向你道歉
I apologize to you on behalf of my family.

687
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,030
接受道歉
Apology accepted.

688
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,040
你知道吗
And you know what?

689
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,570
他是该进监狱  这对他再好不过
He should go to jail -- best thing for him.

690
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,130
让他学会尊重长辈
Teach him respect for his elders.

691
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,300
但是  用不着待八年
But... not for eight years --

692
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,670
应该少好几年
less, much less.

693
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,000
你懂我的意思吗
You see what I'm getting at?

694
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,430
不怎么懂
Not really.

695
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:28,490
非法持有枪支  得判八年  可能十年
The gun charge -- that's 8 years he's going away, maybe 10.

696
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,510
重度攻击  非法持枪  还抢了你的钱包
Aggravated assault, the gun, plus he got your wallet.

697
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,690
没错
That's right.

698
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,800
我希望你能告诉警方
I would like for you to tell the police

699
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,680
枪是你的
that the gun was yours.

700
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,610
是吗
Would you?

701
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,670
他怀疑你撞了他的车
You're both ‭a little hot under the collar

702
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,320
你们俩都没控制住情绪
about whether ‭you bumped his car or not.

703
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,430
你们扭打了起来  然后他抢了你的枪
But there was a scuffle, and, uh, he got your gun.

704
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,120
我的枪
My gun?

705
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,060
他从你的口袋里拿了你的枪
Your gun from your pocket -- he got it,

706
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,220
所以枪上有他的指纹
and that's how his prints got on it.

707
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,170
那我就要面临非法持枪的指控了
And then I'd be subject to the gun charge.

708
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,950
你当过警察
You're an ex-cop.

709
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,180
他们不会为难你
They'll go easy on you.

710
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,980
你还知道别人怎么想啊
So you're a psychic.

711
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,010
我会拧着屠库的耳朵让他给你道歉
I'll even twist Tuco's ear, make him apologize.

712
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:25,150
他的罪名只有殴打他人  没有其他的了
And he serves for battery -- nothing else.

713
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:34,610
这结果对大家都是最好的
I'm looking for the best possible outcome for everybody.

714
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,370
至于给你造成的麻烦
And for your trouble...

715
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,360
给你五千块
you take home $5,000.

716
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,830
好好考虑一下
Think about it.
