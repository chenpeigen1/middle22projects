往前

左转
Turn to the left.

4
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,710
冰爽礼物
从我们的家到你们的家

到卡车后面来
Step around the back of the truck.

6
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,640
行了
Okay.

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,640
给
Here you go.

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,570
绝命律师
第二季 第八集

10
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,410
我本来想带你去个
You know, I was willing to take you

11
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,560
更高端的地方
to a more high-end establishment.

12
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,180
这值得好好庆祝一番
This requires a proper celebration,

13
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,940
所以这一餐不算
so don't think that this counts.

14
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,560
这很完美了
This is perfect.

15
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,540
热狗屋

16
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,160
再说...
Besides...

17
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,040
我们现在得省吃俭用
we're pinching pennies now.

18
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,730
等我们有了稳定的收入
When we have a steady revenue stream,

19
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,290
每晚都要开到杰洛尼莫去吃饭
make the drive up ‭to Geronimo every night.

20
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,720
-在那之前...  -没错
- Till then... - ‭Yes. That.

21
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,040
一起实现这愿望吧
Let's make that happen.

22
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,300
你接下来这样
Okay, here's what ya gotta do.

23

00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,480
对
‭Yeah.

26
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,620
当然是先吃完你的热狗...
Well, I mean, finish your hot dog first, but...

27
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,180
今天晚上就把辞职信放到霍华德的办公室
Now, you put that letter into Howard's office tonight.

28
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,940
算是在他的地盘上正式通知他
It's on his premises. You've officially given notice.

29
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,700
明天早上
Tomorrow morning,

30
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,290
他打高尔夫打得不亦乐乎时
while he's still out on the back nine chasin' his balls,

31
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,670
你就打给梅萨维德和其他委托人
you call Mesa Verde and your other clients,

32
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,340
把他们拉过来
you bring 'em along.

33
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,730
得比他先下手
You get to them before he does.

34
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,520
-不行  -什么  不
- No. ‭- What? No.

35
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,640
你必须现在行动
You gotta act now.

36
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,840
你如果用"正确方法"
Listen, ‭you do this the "Right way,"

37
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,500
等着当面告诉霍华德
you wait, ‭you tell Howard to his face,

38
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,200
他会在你说出"辞职"两字前
he'll sink his dirty hooks into Mesa Verde

39
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,210
就向梅萨维德伸出魔爪
before you get the words "I quit" outta your mouth.

40
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,570
够了吉米  很感谢你的建议
Okay, Jimmy, I appreciate the advice,

41
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,860
但重点是
but the whole point of this

42
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,150
你当你的律师  我当我的
is for you to be your kind of lawyer and me to be mine.

43
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,710
我要采用对我而言正确的方法
I need to find a way to do this that's right for me.

44
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,970
你好  金  能长话短说吗
Hey, Kim. Can we make this quick?

45
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,330
我有点忙不过来了
I'm kinda swamped right now.

46
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,270
当然  谢谢你抽空见我
Uh, sure. ‭Thanks for meeting with me.

47
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,370
我只需要占用几分钟
I only need a few minutes.

48
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,790
很好  什么事
Great. What's up?

49
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,560
霍华德  我们能到你办公室里说吗
Howard, ‭could we do this in your office?

50
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,980
拜托
Please?

51
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,340
再次感谢你抽空
Again, ‭thanks for taking the time.

52
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,620
你没必要拐弯抹角
You can just... go ahead ‭and rip off the Band-Aid.

53
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,860
我大概知道你来这里的目的
I have a pretty good idea why you're here.

54
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,680
那么  你选择去斯韦卡特和考科利
So, you're going with Schweikart and Cokely.

55
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,910
-什么  -我听说了
- I'm sorry? - ‭I heard.

56
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,360
小道消息
Through the grapevine.

57
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,940
我不去其他律所
I'm not going to another firm.

58
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,190
我要自立门户
I'm starting my own.

59
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,080
我打算尝试个体律师
I figured I'd try giving it a go as a solo practitioner.

60
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,140
我...
I, uh...

61
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,150
我意识到这是我该做的
I realized it was something I needed to do.

62
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,360
‭吉米离开戴维斯梅因律所的同一周
The week ‭Jimmy exits Davis & Main,

63
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,740
你也决定要离开我们
you decide to leave us?

64
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,530
这不可能是巧合
That can't just be happenstance.

65
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,880
不是
It's not.

66
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,290
我们会分摊支出
We're gonna be sharing expenses.

67
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,330
共用办公室  但是两人独立执业
One office, ‭but two separate practices.

68
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,480
各方面看来都...很聪明
Smart -- on several counts.

69
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,890
霍华德
Howard...

70
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,870
我希望你知道  我很珍惜在这里的时间
I want you to know ‭that I appreciate my time here.

71
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,950
你和律所为我做的每件事我都感激不已
I'm grateful for everything you and the firm have done for me,

72
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,160
特别是支付我的学费
especially the financial help with my schooling,

73
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,310
我准备写支票偿还剩余的贷款
and I'm ready to write a check for the remainder of the loan.

74
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,290
只需要会计那边给我确切金额
I just need accounting to get me that figure.

75
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,280
不用了  当作赠礼吧
No need. Our gift to you.

76
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,600
我不知道该说什么了
I don't know what to say.

77
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,760
谢谢你
Thank you.

78
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,840
你应得的
You earned it.

79
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,460
说实话  我有点羡慕
Tell you the truth, I'm kinda envious.

80
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,410
真的吗  为什么
Really? Why?

81
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,190
新的开始
Something about a fresh start.

82
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,410
想当年  我刚从法学院毕业
Back in the day, right out of law school,

83
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,580
我慎重考虑过自己挂牌营业
I thought long and hard about hanging up my own shingle.

84
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,850
-真的吗  -是的
- Oh, yeah? ‭- Yeah.

85
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,890
我已经准备好闯荡世界  改变世界
Oh, I was ready to take on the world, make a difference.

86
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,290
老爸说服了我
Dad talked me out of it.

87
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,970
要我加入在这里的生意
Wanted me to join the ranks here,

88
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,340
在律所名里再加一个"H"
throw another "H" In the firm's logo.

89
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,290
一切都还算顺利吧
Things work out the way they're supposed to, I guess.

90
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,380
金  我想告诉你  我总是对你施压
Kim, I want you to know that I always pushed you harder

91
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,990
是因为我相信你可以不断突破自我
because I knew that I could expect more from you.

92
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,490
祝你好运
Good luck to you.

93
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,460
谢谢
Thank you.

94
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,470
帮我打给梅萨维德银行的凯文·沃弛泰尔
Get me Kevin Wachtell at Mesa Verde.

95
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,110
取消今早所有安排
And cancel everything I had lined up this morning.

96
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,430
我这就打
Calling now.

97
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,760
不好意思
Sorry.

98
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,220
借过
Excuse me.

99
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,470
嗨  佩琪  我是金
Hi, Paige. It's Kim.

100
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,750
你好
Yeah, hi.

101
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,630
我想确认一下定在周一中午的午餐
Just checking that we're still on for lunch on Monday.

102
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,150
好极了  凯文也来吗
Great. And Kevin, too?

103
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,430
好的
Good.

104
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,820
在见面之前
Well, before we meet,

105
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,670
我有个新情况要告诉你们
there's some news you need to know about.

106
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,780
柠檬  水果  菠萝

107
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:33,750
希腊甜品屋

108
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,020
我不是安全的选择
I am not the safe choice.

109
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,920
安全的选择是哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
The safe choice for you would be HHM.

110
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,010
但我觉得我才是...
I believe, however, that I am...

111
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,920
正确的选择
the right choice.

112
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,570
为什么
Why?

113
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,680
你现在穿的西装是店里买的成衣吗
That suit you're wearing -- did you buy it off the rack?

114
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,910
别告诉我这看上去像成衣
Please don't tell me it looks like I did. ‭

115
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,150
如果像店里随便买的  我就不会问了
If it did, I wouldn't have asked.

116
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,340
那为什么你要选择订做的呢
So why do you prefer a tailor-made suit?

117
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,030
因为那是最适合你的
Because it fits you and you alone.

118
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,270
每一针每一线都是为你考虑
Because each and every stitch was fretted over with you in mind.

119
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,780
要么你去适合西装
Either you fit the jacket...

120
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,270
要么它适合你
or the jacket fits you.

121
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,260
如果我要一整个仓库的西装呢
What if I want ‭a whole warehouse full of suits?

122
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,370
那可需要很多人来缝制
That's a hell of a lot of sewing.

123
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,090
一个裁缝如何独自完成这项任务呢
How's one single tailor gonna get that job done?

124
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,410
我完全了解你们银行对于扩张的需求
I know your bank's needs in regard to this expansion inside and out.

125
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,200
梅萨维德作为我唯一的委托人
Having Mesa Verde as my sole client

126
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,710
一定会占用我全部的精力
will take up the entirety of my attention, to be sure.

127
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,770
但如果我不能胜任
But if this were beyond my abilities,

128
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,530
我就不会接
I wouldn't be ‭throwing my hat in the ring.

129
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,360
我不会浪费你们的时间
I would not waste your time,

130
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,160
以及我的时间
or mine.

131
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,220
你来啦  金  我们在里面
Oh, hey, Kim! We're in here!

132
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,900
来得正好  我正在看房
Perfect timing. ‭I was just getting the tour.

133
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,390
-金  这是史蒂夫  -你好
- Kim, this is Steve. - ‭Hi.

134
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,340
史蒂夫是这里的中介
Steve's the agent for the place.

135
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,590
-你好  我叫金  -见到你很高兴
- Hi. Kim. ‭- Nice to meet ya.

136
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,970
-金  -一切还好吗
- Hi, Kim. - ‭Everything okay?

137
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,860
怎么样
What do you think?

138
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,670
我  我觉得这是间牙医诊所吧
I, uh... I think it's a -- it's a dentist's office.

139
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,550
两间牙医诊室
Two offices for two dentists,

140
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,690
大小相同  陈设都是对称的
each the exact same size with a mirrored layout.

141
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,490
来
Here.

142
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,850
另一间就在隔壁
The other one is the next door over,

143
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,410
两个靠在一起
right beside this one.

144
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,960
就在这
Right here.

145
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,640
但是共用一个大厅
But they share one lobby,

146
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,760
一个接待区  相当平等
one reception area, so egalitarian as hell.

147
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,970
而且很高效
Not to mention efficient.

148
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,830
还有
Oh, also...

149
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,650
隔音墙壁
soundproof walls,

150
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,990
隔绝钻子啊惨叫啊之类的声音
what with the drilling and the pain and the whatnot.

151
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,310
还有这个地段  棒极了
And the location, I mean, holy crap.

152
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,130
我觉得就是这里了
I think this is the place.

153
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,900
金
Kim?

154
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,940
是啊  很好  隔音的
Yeah, it's great. Soundproofing.

155
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,350
史蒂夫  我们能不能单独
Hey, Steve, do you mind if we just...?

156
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,980
没事
Oh, please.

157
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,830
我出去打几个电话
I'll step outside ‭and make some phone calls.

158
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,660
你们慢慢说
Y'all take all the time you need.

159
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,480
午饭不顺利吗
Bad lunch, huh?

160
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,150
梅萨维德拒绝了你吗
Mesa Verde said no?

161
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,030
我弄不清情况了
Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.

162
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,320
这是代表好的...
I-is this a good --

163
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,620
吉米  我搞定了
Jimmy, I got it.

164
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,670
-你搞定梅萨维德银行了  -是的
- You got Mesa Verde? ‭- Yes!

165
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,560
还没签正式文件
I mean, ‭there's nothing in writing yet,

166
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,930
但是午餐非常
but the lunch went...

167
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,470
非常顺利
It kicked ass.

168
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,800
当时形势确实有点危险
It was a little touch-and-go there for a moment, I'll admit,

169
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,940
但佩琪替我说话  帮了很大的忙
but Paige pitched in, and she really talked me up.

170
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,930
一等他松了口...
And then once ‭that door cracked open --

171
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,480
击个掌  棒极了
High five. Fantastic. ‭

172
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,290
我对每一个问题和担忧都准备了答案
I-I had an for answer question, every concern,

173
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,410
也完全没说哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所的坏话
and I did not bad-mouth HHM, not at all,

174
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,130
但是我很有激情
but I was, like, enthusiasm, you know,

175
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,090
还有私人服务  肯定也因为这个
and personal service, because that's gotta count for something.

176
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,790
-当然了  -就是啊
- Shit, yeah, that counts! - ‭Exactly!

177
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,590
毕竟
I mean, 'cause, like,

178
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,740
他们一开始怎么会到哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
why were they even at HHM in the first place?

179
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,390
还不是因为我  所以  我们走出餐馆时
Me. So, uh -- Oh, and then when we walked out of the restaurant,

180
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,190
凯文看不见的时候  佩琪朝我竖大拇指
when Kevin wasn't looking, Paige gives me a thumbs-up.

181
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,910
不是普通的竖一根
But not -- ‭not the regular thumbs-up.

182
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,050
是两根
The double thumbs-up.

183
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,420
两个  双筒枪
Two. ‭Double barrel.

184
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,300
砰砰  像这样
Boom, boom. Just like that.

185
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,080
我就知道
I knew it.

186
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,660
-我就知道你可以的  -真是...
- I knew you could do it! - ‭It was just...

187
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,700
真是太好了
God, it was perfect.

188
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,010
怎么了
What?

189
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,370
我喜欢看到你现在的样子
I just -- ‭I love seeing you like this.

190
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,350
我们要留着这些椅子吗
So, are we gonna keep these chairs?

191
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,450
你是说你喜欢这个办公室吗
Does that mean you like this office?

192
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,210
咱们就这么办吧
Let's do it.

193
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,040
没问题
Hell, yeah.

194
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,560
就这么办吧
Let's do it.

195
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,010
欧内斯托  门没锁
Ernesto, the door's open...

196
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,230
像往常一样
...as always.

197
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,120
欧内斯托
Ernesto?

198
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,040
是我  查克
It's me, Chuck.

199
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,640
霍华德  欧内斯托和你一起吗
Oh, hey, Howard, is Ernesto with you?

200
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,040
没有  只有我
No, it's just me.

201
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,540
我等文件等了一个小时了
Well, I expected a round of documents an hour ago.

202
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,890
我们马上要去立案了
You know ‭we've got a filing coming up.

203
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,260
我知道  查克
I know, Chuck.

204
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,770
我们很有可能...
It's very possible...

205
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,910
我们可能要失去梅萨维德银行了
It's likely ‭that we're losing Mesa Verde.

206
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,660
失去  我们刚刚才拿下他们
Losing them? We just got them.

207
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,470
为什么  他们打算去找谁
Well, why? Where are they going?

208
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,940
去找金·韦克斯勒
They're going with Kim Wexler.

209
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,250
她职辞了
‭She left the firm.

210
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,840
金辞职了
Kim left?

211
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,390
霍华德
Oh, Howard.

212
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,680
她要去哪里
Well, where's she going?

213
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,230
里奇·斯韦卡特那里吗
Is it Rich Schweikart?

214
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,670
还是里夫斯和格林律所
Or did Reeves and Green get her?

215
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,330
都不是  不是跳槽
Mnh. Not another firm.

216
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,990
她要单干了
She's going into private practice.

217
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,060
什么
What?

218
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,590
这真是...
Well, that's completely...

219
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,000
她要怎么自己单干呢
H-how is she going out on her own?

220
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,210
她为什么要单干呢
Why is she going out on her own?

221
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,080
没什么原因
Well, the why is the why.

222
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,340
至于怎么干  她正准备和吉米联手
The how is that ‭she's pooling her resources... with Jimmy.

223
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,470
金和我弟弟  成了合伙人吗
Kim and my brother -- partners at law?

224
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,990
他是斯文加利
He's Svengali.

225
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,520
小说《特里比》中的人物  用催眠术控制女主人公

226
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,520
这家伙是个催眠大师
The man is Svengali.

227
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,370
不管怎样  关于梅萨维德银行
At any rate, back to Mesa Verde.

228
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
我打算孤注一掷
I'm gonna try one last Hail Mary.

229
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,240
查克
Uh, Chuck?

230
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,950
-梅萨维德银行  -我听着呢
- Mesa Verde. - ‭Yes, listening.

231
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:34,670
我争取了和凯文·沃弛泰尔见面的机会
I managed to get a meeting with Kevin Wachtell.

232
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,010
他下午到
He's coming in this afternoon.

233
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,860
但我不是很清楚该遵从哪些法
But compliance law is not my strong suit.

234
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,960
所以如果你有任何论点论据
So if you have any details, any arguments,

235
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,380
现在赶快告诉我
bullet-point them for me now,

236
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,550
我只有一个小时的时间
'cause I got about an hour before I have to get back.

237
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,120
查克
Chuck?

238
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,890
我真的很需要你的帮助
I really need your help here.

239
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,800
查克
Chuck?

240
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,460
你还好吧
Are you okay?

241
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,720
我也去参加会议
I'm going to that meeting.

242
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,590
查克  这样也许不好吧
Chuck, I don't know if that's a good idea.

243
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,840
我可以的
I can do it.

244
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,170
我会靠意志力坚持
Force of will.

245
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:11,990
而且我已经好多了
And I've been getting better.

246
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,710
我知道  但是...
I know you have, but...

247
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,390
想想我们要传递的信息
the message that we want to send.

248
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,960
我懂
I know the message --

249
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,430
要表现得专业  而不是疯狂
that we appear professional and not crazy!

250
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,440
我要去开会  灯给我开着
I'm going to the meeting and the lights stay on.

251
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,430
大家都带着手机
Everyone keeps their phones.

252
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,960
一切正常就行
Everything stays, for lack of a better word, normal.

253
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,430
我会挺过来的
I will make it through.

254
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,230
请进
‭Yeah?

255
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,350
他们到了
They're here.

256
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,990
好的
Okay.

257
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,350

-抱歉我来晚了  -你们好
- Sorry I was delayed. - Oh. Hi.

259
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,900
不不  完全没有  我们刚坐下
No, no. Not at all. We just sat down.

260
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,280
凯文·沃弛泰尔  佩奇·诺维克
Kevin Wachtell, Paige Novick,

261
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,380
这位是查尔斯·麦吉尔
this is Charles McGill.

262
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,970

感谢你们两位前来
Thank you both for coming.

266
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,650
别担心
And don't worry.

267
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,750
请二位来不是来听我吹嘘HHM的
I'm not here ‭to extol the virtues of HHM.

268
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,530
我猜你们已经受够了
‭I'm guessing you've already had to suffer through

269
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,480
霍华德对于律所的强行推销了
Howard's hard sell first time around,

270
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,690
依我看  你们已经听够了
so you've done your time, as far ‭as I'm concerned.

271
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,170
才不是强行推销  那只是热情待客
What hard sell? It was enthusiasm.

272
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:54,270
我还给他们拿了饼干呢
I gave them cookies.

273
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,130
饼干还挺好吃的
Cookies were good, as I recall.

274
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,240
我今天来是想让你们放心
No, I'm here to put your minds at ease.

275
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,250
金·韦克斯勒
Kim Wexler is,

276
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,290
的确是处理梅萨维德业务的不二人选
indeed, the right choice to handle Mesa Verde.

277
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,910
选择她很明智
She's the obvious choice.

278
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,520
她年轻又聪明  前途无量
She's young, she's brilliant, she's going places.

279
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,100
咱们面对现实吧  霍华德
Let's face it, Howard.

280
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,730
她才是未来
She's the future.

281
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,120
像我俩这种老人家  已经过时了
Two old guys like us, we're the past.

282
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,400
真是让人悲伤的看法
Well, that's a sad thought.

283
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
悲伤但现实
‭Sad but true.

284
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,460
银行法...需要激情
Banking law... needs to be exciting.

285
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,850
需要下一代崛起的新秀
It needs the next generation to come along

286
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,460
为它注入新鲜血液
and give it a big, old kick in the seat of the pants.

287
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,850
真正唤醒它
Really wake it up.

288
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,930
我告诉你们我有多无聊
Let me tell ya how boring I am.

289
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,270
我靠读FEC和ISO报告来打发时间
I read FEC and ISO reports for entertainment.

290
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,860
没错  我能证明
He does. I can attest to that.

291
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,970
我想努力跟上潮流
Well, I try to stay up on things.

292
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,330
规则时刻在改变
The rules are changing all the time.

293
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,950
安然和世通出事了以后
With everything that's happened with Enron and WorldCom,

294
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,070
政府格外警惕
the government is extra vigilant.

295
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,270
现在  即便是最无心的过错
These days, the penalties for even the most honest

296
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,480
也可能招致毁灭性的后果
of errors can be devastating.

297
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,260
你需要年轻敏锐的眼光把握这些动向
You need a sharp, ‭young eye to catch that stuff.

298
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,890
当你已经在这个领域
I mean, when you've specialized in this kind of work

299
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,500
纵横了十多年  就会变得有点...
for decades on end, you tend to get kinda...

300
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,340
-陈腐  -陈腐
- Stale. ‭- Stale.

301
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,670
你会变得很陈腐
You get stale.

302
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,210
你会忘掉那些  譬如
You forget about things like, oh, I don't know,

303
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,840
《社区再投资法案》
the Community Reinvestment Act.

304
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,350
像梅萨维德银行这样想设新支行的银行
Any bank such as Mesa Verde looking to open a de novo branch

305
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,890
必须展现符合该法案的
is definitely going to need to show a healthy portfolio

306
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,650
健康投资组合
of CRA compliance.

307
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,170
当然是开玩笑了
Duh. Obviously.

308
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,330
我相信这方面你们肯定都做好了
You guys have all that covered, I'm sure.

309
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,000
《里格-尼尔州际银行和分行效益法》
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act --

310
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,330
真是拗口啊
there's another mouthful, huh?

311
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,660
无聊
Boring!

312
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,130
不过如果你违反该法律
Still, ‭if you were to run afoul of it,

313
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,980
可能得打上好几年官司
it could hold you up in court for years.

314
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,670
顺便  如果你们在没有我们的情况下
And by the way, uh, if that were to happen to you folks

315
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,110
发生这种事  不过当然不会了
as you go forward without us, which it will not, um,

316
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,430
霍华德在美联储有人能够帮忙处理
Howard has contacts at the Fed who could help sort things out.

317
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,540
一两个吧
One or two.

318
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,120
还有证券交易委员会对
And then there's the SEC's interpretation

319
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,960
《萨奥法案》302节的阐释
of Section 302 of Sarbox.

320
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,600
小心行事
Well, navigating that correctly

321
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,520
可以省下好几十万呢
could mean savings of several hundred thousand dollars.

322
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,110
他们很清楚呢  霍华德
They know that, Howard.

323
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,640
抱歉
Aapologize.

324
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,460
人到了一定岁数
When you reach your golden years,

325
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,530
就会变得有点啰啰嗦嗦
you tend ‭to get a little long-winded,

326
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,860
老是念叨着一些细节
ramble on and on about details.

327
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,320
我想说  你的银行在可靠的人手上
My point being, ‭your bank is in excellent hands.

328
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,560
我明白你想说什么  真的
Look, I take your point. I do.

329
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,900
但我要说
But I have to say,

330
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,770
我对韦克斯勒女士很有信心
I have complete confidence in Ms. Wexler.

331
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,860
你是该如此
You should.

她在我们团队中待过
She was part of our team.

334
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,740
找不到比金·韦克斯勒更合适的人选了
You won't find better than Kim Wexler.

335
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,540
但是不管她多么优秀
But no matter how talented one individual may be,

336
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,400
梅萨维德的业务太重  一个人没法做
the needs of Mesa Verde are too big to handle alone.

337
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,750
我是不会单独处理你们今后的扩张
I wouldn't handle ‭your coming expansion alone.

338
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,280
所以你应该再考虑一下

339
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,850
交给我们这样专业的团队

开什么玩笑  这是我的荣幸

为了战争英雄  可以小小地破个例

介意我们跟你拍张照吗

00:30:53,750 --> 00:31:01,250
213平方米办公空间

502
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,680
梅萨维德银行跑了
I lost Mesa Verde.

503
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,820
-什么  -我之前说服他了
- What? - ‭I had him.

504
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,020
我以为说服了
I thought I had him.

505
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,500
怎么回事
‭So what happened?

506
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,150
他们继续和哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所合作
They're s-sticking with HHM.

507
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,650
佩奇说他们今天下午过去
Paige said they went over there this afternoon

508
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,910
进行出于礼貌的会面
for some kind of... courtesy meeting,

509
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,150
反正她是这么以为  但凯文改变想法了
or so she thought, ‭and Kevin got his head turned.

510
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,770
-霍华德说服的吗  -不
- By Howard? - ‭No.

511
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,810
查克
Chuck.

512
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,320
吉米  我得问
Jimmy, I have to ask.

513
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,210
你还想这么做吗
You still up for doing this?

514
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,690
你说租下办公室吗
What? You mean getting the office?

515
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,380
这一切
All of it.

516
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,240
我想我们也许得
I think maybe we need to...

517
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,070
放慢脚步  好好...
slow down and really, you know...

518
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,640
考虑这事
think about this.

519
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,480
等等
Wait. Whoa.

520
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,400
-都没变  -都没变吗
- Nothing's changed. - N-nothing's changed?

521
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,540
我们马上要签下非常贵的租约
We're about to sign a very expensive lease

522
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,750
但一大笔收入已经不翼而飞了
after a very sizable chunk of income just went flying out the window.

523
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,120
这就是团队的意义
That's why we're a team.

524
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,860
这种事总会发生
Something like this happens --

525
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,020
你帮我  我帮你
you're there to help me, I'm there to help you.

526
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,680
还会有梅萨维德这种大客户的
There will be other Mesa Verdes.

527
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,680
你还是想继续吗
So you still wanna do this?

528
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,180
吉米...
Jimmy...

529
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,020
我完全按你说的做
I did everything you said,

530
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,650
但他并未好转
but he's not getting any better.

531
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,930
你做得很好  欧尼
You did good, Ernie.

532
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:11,910
谢谢
Thanks.

533
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,140
你回家休息一下吧
Why don't you, uh, ‭go home and get some sleep?

534
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,210
我来接手
I'll take over.

535
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,990
他说想让我留下
He told me he wanted me to stay.

536
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,700
没关系  我来了
It's okay. I'm here now.

537
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,330
你下次见霍华德时
And, uh, next time you see Howard,

538
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,510
告诉他你要大大加薪
tell him you need a raise -- a big one.

539
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,420
查克  兄弟
Chuck, buddy?

540
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,050
感觉如何
‭How you feeling?

541
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:50,100
梅萨维德

542
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,870
梅萨维德

543
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,190
你好
Hey, how's it going?

544
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,330
我需要美工刀  尺子  要木头的
I need an X-ACTO knife, a ruler -- wood, please --

547
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,550
我要用最好的复印机
Oh, and point me to your best copier.

548
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,400
-最好的复印机  -没错  最好的复印机
- Best copier? - ‭Yeah. Best copier.

549

C'mon. Di di mau.

550
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,010
这个礼拜  十分古怪*
*Been a strange old week

551
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,160
未做之事  遇见之人*
*With the stuff you didn't do and the people that you meet

552
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,310
挖掘信息  就像拔牙*
*And digging up the words like pulling teeth

553
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,620
一副面孔  一个数字*
*Got a face, a number

554
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,770
以及她使用的化名*
*And a name that she goes under

555
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,140
也许这已相当不错*
*I guess there's plenty worse place to be

556
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,780
那你为何不干*
*So why don't you do it

557
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,840
那你为何不干*
*Yeah, why don't you do it

558
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:22,000
多点享乐  又有何妨*
*Ain't no harm in having just a bit more fun

559
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,570
无论自己  喜不喜欢*
*Whether you like it or not

560
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,220
永远别摆  一副臭脸*
*Make no place for dragging down your face

561
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,630
你该知道这是最好的结果*
*Don't you know it's the best one that you got

562
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,620
那你为何不干*
*So why don't you do it

563
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,560
那你为何不干*
*Yeah, why don't you do it

564
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,060

*Why don't you do it, ooh

565
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:50,460
那你为何不干*
*Why don't you do it

566
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,550
抢劫银行*
*Break that bank

567
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,720
你可能一无所获*
*You never know, you might draw blanks

568
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,020
然后还被绳之以法*
*Then again, it might sort you out

569
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,840
那你为何不干  为何不干  为何不干*
*So why don't you do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

570
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,890
干啊*
*Do it

571
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,210
干啊*
*Do it

572
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,330
他起来了
He emerges.

573
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,000
下午好
Good afternoon.

574
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,770
下午了吗
Is it afternoon?

575
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,000
欧内斯托人呢
Where's Ernesto?

576
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,960
他应该留下来陪我的
He was supposed to stay with me.

577
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,450
别怪欧尼
Don't get mad at Ernie.

578
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,960
他花了一天中最好的时间
He spent the better part of a day

579
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,450
欣赏你烤土豆[裹锡纸]的表演
watching you do your impression of a baked potato.

580
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,220
我让他回家去睡会
I told him to go home, get some shut eye.

581
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,740
你饿吗
‭You hungry?

582
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,900
除了饼干还想吃点什么吗
You want something besides crackers?

583
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,240
不用  我没事
No, I'm fine.

584
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,570
等我的胃不难受了我自己弄点东西吃
I'll fix myself something after my stomach settles.

585
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,920
在外面待这么久
Really doing a number on yourself,

586
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,270
真把你伤得不轻
spending so much time out of the house.

587
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,080
你就非得这么干  是吧
You just had to do it, huh?

588
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,960
不能眼看着金挖走梅萨维德银行
Couldn't stand ‭to let Kim have Mesa Verde.

589
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,290
就非得从她手上抢走
You had to swipe it from her.

590
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,800
我没有抢走任何东西
I didn't swipe anything.

591
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,330
我们只是留住委托人
We retained our client.

592
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,720
你和霍华德甚至都没听说过这个银行
You and Howard never even heard about Mesa Verde

593
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,270
是金把它捧到你们面前的
till Kim brought it to ya on a red velvet pillow.

594
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,470
我要去冲个澡  还有一堆工作要处理
I need a shower, and I've got a ton of work to do.

595
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,650
如果你想吵架  吉米
So if you're lookin' for a fight, Jimmy,

596
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,050
我实在没心情和你吵
I just don't have it in me.

597
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,360
吉米
Jimmy.

598
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,810
谢谢你留下来陪我
Thanks for stayin' with me.

599
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,250
我们之间有积怨未解
I know we have our issues,

600
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,340
但是  如果我俩换一下
but if things were reversed,

601
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,110
我希望你知道  我也会一样待你
I hope you know that I would do the same for you.

602
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,290
干得真不错
You're doing a great job.

603
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,080
你以前做过这个吗
You done this before?

604
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,640
没有  没做过这样的
No, not like this,

605
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,630
不过我们在学校里学过分数
but we learned about fractions in school.

606
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,190
是吗  什么分数
You did? What fractions?

607
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,580
二分之一英寸  四分之一英寸
1/2 inch, 1/4 inch,

608
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,600
八分之一英寸  十六分之一英寸
1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.

609
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,840
你知道吗  我得承认
You know, I gotta tell ya,

610
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:23,280
我在你这个年纪的时候可没你聪明
you are much smarter than I was when I was your age.

611
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,450
或许是你老师教得不够好
Maybe you needed better teachers.

612
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:28,870
有可能
That could be.

613
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,900
能让我来钻吗
Can I do the drill now?

614
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,270
你答应了的
You promised.

615
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,270
是呀  我是答应了
I did, didn't I?

616
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:39,220
好了  过来
Okay, get up here.

617
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,810
用重型工具的时候
Now, you're gonna have to wear these

618
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,790
得戴上这个
if you're gonna handle the heavy machinery.

619
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,200
你怎么不戴
W-why don't you have to wear them?

620
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,160
因为爷爷是大人  大人就可以变笨
Because Pop-Pop's a grown-up, and grown-ups get to be stupid.

621
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,240
好了  戴上
Now, put them on.

622
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:54,810
好的
All right.

623
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,470
这个很重  所以我来拿着
Now, I'm gonna hold this because it's heavy,

624
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,280
我说按扳柄的时候你就按  行吗
but you pull the trigger when I say so, okay?

625
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,710
把手放上来
Now get your hand on it.

626
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,770
好了  拿好了吗
All right, you got it?

627
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,230
准备好了
Ready.

628
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:10,060
好的  准备  按
All right, ready...set...pull.

629
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,700
干得好
Good job.

630
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,870
能再来几次吗
Can we do more? ‭

631
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,350
你帮我放好
You line them up for me.

632
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,180
在家吗
Hello?!

633
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,890
我们在后面
We're back here.

634
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:28,700
这是在干什么
Wow. What's all this?

635
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,760
我们在做一个特制软管
We're making a special hose.

636
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,790
特制软管啊  看出来了
Yeah, that's a special hose, all right.

637
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,200
我每隔四分之三英寸做一个记号
I made marks every 3/4 inch,

638
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,010
然后爷爷在下面垫上一块木头
then Pop-Pop put a piece of wood down

639
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,870
这样就不会划到桌子了
so he doesn't ruin his table.

640
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,260
然后我们在标记号的地方钻孔
Then we line up a drill, put the hole on the "X."

641
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,280
我要给外面的杜鹃花做个滴灌管
I needed a soaker ‭for the rhododendrons out back.

642
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,550
好了  爷爷要自己完成工作了
Well, Pop-Pop's gonna have to finish his project on his own,

643
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,630
我们得走了
because we have to go.

644
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,630
可我们还没做完呢
But we're not done yet.

645
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,420
没事  我会做好的
No, I'll finish up.

646
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,840
小公主  你已经帮了我很大的忙了
But you, young lady, were a big help.

647
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,490
抱抱
Give me a hug.

648
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,420
爱你  宝贝
Love you, girl.

649
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:11,360
-我也爱你  -谢谢  麦克
- Love you. ‭- Thanks, Mike.

650
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,670
对了  你周五还是有空的吧
Oh, you still good for Friday?

651
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,700
当然
Absolutely.

652
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,740
我到时候再找个东西让她玩
I'll think of another project by then.

653
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,410
太好了  再见
Fantastic. Bye.

654
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,370
再见
Bye.

655
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,680
我午餐已经约了人了
I have a lunch date already.

656
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,460
-推了  -不能推
- Well, break it. - ‭I cannot break it.

657
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,640
能别碰我吗
Will you take your hands off me?

658
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,980
你以为你是正骨医生吗
What are you playing, osteopath?

659
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,910
别激动
Temper, temper.

660
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:00,890
沃尔特  你已经不是我的丈夫了
Oh, listen, Walter, you are no longer my husband

661
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:02,560
也不再是我的老板
and no longer my boss.

662
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,120
我以后也不会再为你工作了
And you're not gonna be my boss.

663
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:06,920
如果你满足于当编辑和记者
Well, it would've worked out if you'd been satisfied

664
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,480
事情就不会这样  可你就不
with just being editor and reporter, but not you.

665
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,180
你非要嫁给我  毁了这一切
You had to marry me, spoil everything.

666
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,240
我不满足  那是我求的婚咯
I wasn't satisfied? I suppose I proposed to you.

667
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,060
差不多就是  你连着两年
Well, you practically did, making goo-goo eyes at me

668
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,340
整天对我送秋波  直到我松口
for two years until I broke down.

669
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,690
"啊  沃尔特"
"Oh, Walter."

670
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,190
而且我那晚是喝醉了才向你求的婚
And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed to ya.

671
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,950
如果你是个绅士
If you'd have been a gentleman,

672
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,550
就该忘了那晚的事  可你就不
you'd have forgotten all about it, but not you.

673
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,550
你竟敢
Why, you!

674
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,410
你眼力不如以往了
You're losing your eye.

675
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,850
你以前扔得可比这准多了
You used to be able to pitch better than that.

676
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,700
你好  是的  怎么了  斯威尼
Hello? Yeah. What? Sweeney?

677
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,130
有什么我能帮忙的吗
Well, what can I do for ya?
