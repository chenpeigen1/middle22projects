00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,800
我们不知道他失去意识
We don't know if he lost consciousness

173
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,400
是心脏问题还是轻微中风引起的
because of a heart-related issue or if it was a mild stroke.

174
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,460
我们不知道他脊椎是否受伤
We don't know if his spine has been injured,

175
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,570
脑部是否肿胀
if his brain is swelling.

176
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,990
至少很有可能脑震荡
He likely has a concussion, at least.

177
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,690
查克还是拒绝做检查
Chuck is once again refusing these tests

178
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,150
因为会让他受到"电磁轰炸"
because they involve being bombarded by electricity --

179
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,480
这是他的原话
his words.

180
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,000
跟他上次进医院一模一样
Nothing has changed since the last time he was in here.

181
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,560
我已经解释得很清楚了
Look, I don't know ‭how to explain this any clearer.

182
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,960
我不会让他住院的
I'm not committing him.

183
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,020
那申请临时紧急监护人如何
What about a Temporary Emergency Guardianship?

184
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,110
他符合条件
I mean, he fits the parameters.

185
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,100
你跟我说他急需医疗
You're telling me he's in need of medical care so urgent

186
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,050
没办法等到法庭完成审核程序
that we can't wait around on court procedure.

187
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,120
没错
Most certainly.

188
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,280
而且查克无法理解后果
Yeah. And Chuck is not able to understand the consequences.

189
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,300
他是可以理解  但是他...
I mean, he can ‭understand them, but he --

190
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,270
没错
Absolutely.

191
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,650
法官也会这么理解的
A judge will see it that way, too.

192
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,740
之后我带他回家就可以了
And then I take him home, and it's over.

193
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,650
等待检验结果和适当治疗  可以
Pending results and proper treatment, yes.

194
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,620
我认识个法官  现在就可以联系他
I know a judge we can call right now.

195
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,540
让我来告诉他吧
Let me be the one to tell him.

196
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,550
老兄  你还好吗
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

197
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,020
查克
Chuck.

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,160
你简直是随时待命
Well, if it isn't Johnny-on-the-spot.

199
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,170
什么意思
What? What does that mean?

200
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,580
欧内斯托在外面吗
Is Ernesto out there?

201
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,050
对  你需要什么吗
Yeah. Can I get you something?

202
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,250
欧内斯托
Ernesto!

203
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,350
麻烦你进来
Come in here, please!

204
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,640
放松
Look, just take it easy.

205
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,060
欧内斯托
Ernesto!

206
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,890
把你东西放那儿
Just put your stuff in there.

207
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,420
来了
I got him.

208
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,030
你感觉怎么样  麦吉尔先生
How are you feelin', Mr. McGill?

209
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,230
欧内斯托  在那家复件店里
Ernesto, ‭how long was I unconscious

210
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,400
我昏迷了多久
in that print shop?

211
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,770
我不确定
I'm not sure.

212
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,750
三十秒  一分钟
30 seconds, a minute?

213
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,080
-还是两分钟  -大概有一分钟吧
- 2 minutes? - ‭I'd say maybe about a minute.

214
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,150
你时而清醒时而迷糊
You were kinda in and out.

215
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,580
救护车来之前我在地上躺了多久
And how long was I lying on the floor before the ambulance arrived?

216
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,470
大概有十分钟吧  我没看表
About 10 minutes, I think, but I didn't look at the clock.

217
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,040
而那时你已经到了
And yet, you were there.

218
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,820
查克  我们能不能...
Chuck, can we, uh...

219
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,040
只有一种方法
There's only one way

220
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,880
能让你那么快到达那里
you could have gotten there so quickly --

221
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,930
你根本没走
you never left.

222
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,950
你太激动了
I think you're getting all wound up.

223
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,550
你得深呼吸...
Can you just take a few deep br--

224
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,980
你贿赂了他...
You bribed him --

225
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,790
-那个柜员  -什么
- that kid behind the counter. - What?

226
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,460
趁着欧内斯托离开而我还没到
Between the time Ernesto left and I arrived,

227
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,280
你给了那个笨蛋钱
you paid that half-wit to swear

228
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,680
-让他说他从没见过你  -麦吉尔先生
- he'd never laid eyes on you. - Mr. McGill.

229
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,260
然后你就在附近一直看着
And then you stuck around to watch.

230
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,140
-为什么  想看我受苦吗  -麦吉尔先生
- Why? Just wanted to see me suffer? - Mr. McGill.

231
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,010
想看我出洋相吗
Just wanted to have a laugh at my expense?

232
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,050
我给他打了电话
I called him.

233
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,550
什么
What?

234
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,740
我在接你之前  给吉米打了电话
I called Jimmy earlier, before I picked you up.

235
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,790
他出现是因为我给他打了电话
He showed up when he did because I called him.

236
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,740
我很担心你  所以...
I was worried about you, and I just --

237
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,770
我给他打了电话  对不起
I called him. I'm sorry.

238
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,600
出去  你们两个都出去
Get out...both of you.

239
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,830
查克  有件事我必须得做
Chuck, there's something that I have to do,

240
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,600
真的很抱歉
and I'm really sorry --

241
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,970
真的非常抱歉
really, truly sorry,

242
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,510
但我必须做  为了你好
but I gotta do it, and it's for you.

243
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,600
你想让我住院
You're trying to have me committed.

244
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,240
不  只是临时...
No, it's a Temporary --

245
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,510
临时紧急监护人
Temporary ‭Emergency Guardianship --

246
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,040
说法不同而已
to-may-to, to-mah-to.

247
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,400
你终于把我关起来了
Well, you've finally got me where you want me.

248
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,600
你看起来累坏了
Hey, you look beat.

249
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,490
回家休息吧
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

250
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,560
我还撑得住
I'm fine to hang out, you know?

251
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,780
有什么需要尽管说
Whatever you need.

252
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,990
没事  不用了
Nah. We're good here.

253
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,300
欧尼
Hey, Ernie.

254
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,790
你为什么说你给我打了电话
Uh, how come you said that about callin' me?

255
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,680
我也不知道
I don't know, man.

256
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,180
我本不想多嘴
Look, I didn't want to say anything,

257
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,700
但是你哥哥...
but your brother --

258
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,650
最近他说起你时的样子...
the way he's been ‭talkin' about you lately --

259
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,680
就好像...他真的要收拾你  吉米
it's like...he's really out to get you, Jimmy.

260
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,490
我说不清
And...I don't know.

261
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,110
你是我的朋友
You're my friend.

262
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,250
谢谢
Thanks.

263
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,930
我明天给你电话
I'll call you tomorrow.

264
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,940
真怀念收发室
I miss the mailroom.

265
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,800
你们知道希波克拉底誓言吗
Are you familiar with the Hippocratic oath?

266
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,190
你们应该知道
You should be.

267
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,410
历史上最古老的具有约束力的文件之一
One of the oldest binding documents in history.

268
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,800
首先  不要伤害病人
Primum non nocere -- first, do no harm.

269
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,980
你们这样治疗我是不对的
This is not the way to treat my condition.

270
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,320
就好像  我对青霉素过敏
It's as though I had a -- an allergy to penicillin,

271
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,710
而你们却非要用它来治疗我的感染
and yet, you persist on treating my infection with it.

272
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,730
感谢你做类比  查尔斯
I appreciate the analogy, Charles,

273
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,050
但我觉得这个类比并不恰当
but I don't think it quite fits.

274
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,480
我们会在你不知不觉间
Look, we'll have you in and out of Radiology

275
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,270
就做完放射检查的  好吗
before you know it, all right?

276
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,480
然后我们会摘掉颈托
Then we can see about getting that neck collar off

277
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,950
让你活动活动
and get you moving around.

278
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,130
好了  查尔斯  扫描就要开始了
Okay, Charles, the scan is starting now.

279
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,300
你躺着的台子会移动
The table that you're on is going to move.

280
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,780
你会听到一声比较大的声响
You're gonna hear a sound that might seem loud to you,

281
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,570
但是不用担心
but it's nothing to worry about.

282
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,340
还没消息呢
Still no word?

283
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,180
天啊
Jesus.

284
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,790
到底要花多久啊
How long is this gonna take?

285
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,780
她说整个检查也就十分钟而已
She said that whole test would be like 10 minutes.

286
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,720
也许他们得重做
Maybe they had to start over.

287
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,720
重做二十次吗
What -- 20 times?

288
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,750
他应该回家
He should be home.

289
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,100
吉米  你这么做是对的
Jimmy, you're doin' the right thing.

290
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,220
你能把工作拿出来做吗
Would you get your work out, please?

291
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,150
因为不知道还要在这等多久
Becouse God knows how much longer we're gonna be here.

292
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,150
如果你能做点别的我会感觉好点
I'd feel better ‭if you were doing something,

293
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,440
做点跟医院无关的事
you know, unhospital-y.

294
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,450
跟医院无关的
Unhospital-y.

295
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,820
好的
I'm on it.

296
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,890
我去问一下情况
You know what? I'm gonna go ask for an update.

297
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,140
好主意
Okay. Good idea.

298
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,060
你们是最伟大的一代
You are the greatest generation.

299
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,560
-吉米  -你们没有挑起二战
- Jimmy. ‭- You didn't start World War II,

300
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,800
但却终结了它
but you sure as heck finished it.

301
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,070
如果这还不够
And if that weren't enough,

302
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,300
你们还把九十多米高的火箭送上了月球
you sent a rocket 300 feet tall to the moon.

303
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,310
现在  你们到了迟暮之年
Now, in your golden years,

304
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,710
需要有人照顾
you need someone looking out for you,

305
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,450
需要一个可以信任的人
someone you can trust,

306
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,940
一个言必信  行必果的人
a man who says what he does and does what he says.

307
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,110
当你需要一个可靠的人
When you need someone to count on...

308
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,470
-我选吉米  -我选吉米
- Gimme Jimmy! - Gimme Jimmy!

309
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,980
我选吉米
Gimme Jimmy!

310
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,060
因为现在勇气已经很少见了
Because moxie is in such short supply these days.

311
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,320
吉米·麦吉尔  你可以信赖的律师
Jimmy McGill -- A lawyer you can trust.

312
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,880
太棒了  吉米
It's really good, Jimmy.

313
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
你拍了一条很棒的广告
You made a really good commercial.

314
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,380
谢了
Thanks.

315
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,480
吉米
Jimmy.

316
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,410
总算出来了  他怎么样了
Oh, finally. So, how is he?

317
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,840
好消息是生理上无大碍
Well, the good news is that, physically, he's okay.

318
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,190
放射科医生说查尔斯的
The radiologist said everything looks normal

319
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,850
头和脊椎都很正常
with Charles' head and spine,

320
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,630
所以我们把他的颈圈卸了
so we took his neck collar off.

321
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,490
他头部的伤会很快愈合
His head wound will heal just fine.

322
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,850
给他打了破伤风
We gave him a tetanus shot

323
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,020
因为他的接种记录不是最新的
because his immunization records were not current.

324
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,830
你肯定不意外
I'm sure ‭that's no surprise to you.

325
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,990
那他心脏呢
And -- And -- And his heart?

326
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,860
很强健
Strong.

327
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,660
心电图正常
The EKG was normal.

328
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,220
至于失去知觉  最可能的原因是
As far as losing consciousness, my best guess is

329
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,490
查尔斯的晕厥和压力有关
Charles had what's called a stress-related syncope.

330
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,530
一般是恐慌症发作
It's basically a panic attack,

331
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,550
但没有中风和心脏问题
but no signs of a stroke or cardiac event.

332
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,700
但还是有...
However, there was...

333
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,830
并发症
a complication.

334
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,650
查克  兄弟是我
Chuck? Hey, buddy, it's me.

335
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,380
医生说一切正常  我们出院吧
They said everything looks good, so let's get you outta here.

336
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,570
你说呢
Whaddya say?

337
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,710
他怎么了
What's wrong with him?

338
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,160
药效应该已经过去了  对吧
Whatever you gave him should've worn off already, right?

339
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,360
我们观察他几个小时了
We watched him for several hours.

340
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,800
甚至都用了逆转剂
We even gave him ‭what's called a reversal agent.

341
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,020
没错  镇静剂药效过了
So, yes, the sedative wore off.

342
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,910
-是因为其他原因  -什么原因
- This is something else. ‭- What?

343
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,340
我们认为这是自诱导紧张症
We think it's a state of self-induced catatonia.

344
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,330
"我们"  永远是"我们认为"
"We" -- always with the "We."

345
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,370
我觉得就是你认为
I think it's you.

346
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,370
你是这屋子里唯一的医生
You're the only doctor in the room.

347
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,000
我认为是你用机器烧坏了他的脑子
I think you fried his brain with that machine.

348
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,850
吉米
Jimmy.

349
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,990
-抱歉  真是扯淡  -吉米
- I'm sorry. This is bullshit. - Jimmy.

350
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,630
接下来干嘛
What next?

351
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,190
我第一次治疗查尔斯时  他也是类似的状态
When I first treated Charles, he was in a similar state.

352
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,390
你同意吗
Wouldn't you agree?

353
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,960
我相信他清醒过来
I have to believe ‭that it's just a matter of time

354
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,340
只是时间问题
before he comes out of it.

355
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,480
时间问题
Matter of time.

356
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,850
好  那我就在这等着
Fine, then. I'll wait right here.

357
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,350
偏左  一点五角分
Shot left. 1.5 minutes.

358
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,350
这把枪能连射多少发
How many rounds've gone through the tube?

359
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,080
你说鲁格762狙击枪吗
For a 762?

360
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,920
就算射掉3500发也没啥影响
You can put 3,500 through it and never know.

361
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,250
关键是能射多准
It's about how tight she shoots.

362
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,310
这把枪准得很
And this one's tight as they come.

363
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,800
因为顺射击方向有风
I'd say there's a breeze picking up downrange.

364
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,160
枪管会变冷吗
Your barrel gonna be cold?

365
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,120
希望如此吧
Let's suppose so.

366
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,280
那你开枪最好多留心
Well, then, you'd better have paid attention to that shot.

367
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,100
是啊
I'd better have.

368
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,000
向右调整  一点五角分
Adjusting right, 1.5 minutes.

369
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,010
开枪吧
Send it.

370
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,840
中了
Hit.

371
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,340
正中红心
Center hit.

372
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,410
我建议你不要换子弹
I suggest you don't change up your ammo.

373
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,220
继续用168格令船尾中空弹
Stick with the 168 grain boat-tail hollow point --

374
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,230
如果没有障碍物  选它没错
if it's an open shot, that is.

375
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,430
如果你要射穿很厚的窗户
Now, if you got to shoot through a heavy window,

376
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,060
我建议你换到180格令
I'll up you to a 180.

377
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,740
但你就得重新计算射击参数了
But as you know, you'll have to recalculate the shot.

378
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,100
168就够了
168'll do it.

379
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,410
多少盒
How many boxes?

380
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,400
就一盒
Just the one.

381
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,220
不用了  免费
No, it's on the house.

382
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,400
还有一件事
Uh, one last thing.

383
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,550
无意冒犯
No offense.

384
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,910
没事
None taken.

385
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,060
吉米  可以给我点水吗
Jimmy, can I get some water?

386
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,260
查克  你醒了
Chuck. Hey, buddy, you're back with us.

387
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
你怎么...
How you...

388
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,570
可以给我点水吗
Can I get some water, please?

389
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,930
好好  我去拿
Yeah, yeah, water.

390
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,550
该死  抱歉
Oh, shit. Sorry. ‭

391
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,870
还要吗
Want some more?

392
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,930
我记得最后一件事
Last thing I remember

393
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,790
就是他们把我送进那台机器里
was that machine they put me in.

394
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,750
我昏迷多久了
How long was I out for?

395
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,920
有二十个小时了
Was...20 hours.

396
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,880
下一个任务就是把你带出这鬼地方
And next order of business -- get you the hell outta here.

397
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,050
去哪
Where to next --

398
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,970
拉斯克鲁塞斯的精神病院吗
some insane asylum in Las Cruces?

399
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,800
一个你可以真正把我藏起来的地方吗
Some place you can really tuck me away, but good?

400
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,490
回家  查克  你要回家
Home, Chuck. You're goin' home.

401
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,170
你心脏很好
Well, your heart's okay,

402
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,720
头上的伤也没事
and so is that crack on your head,

403
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,900
这已经很好了
so that's all I wanted to know.

404
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,240
临时紧急监护人呢
What about the T.E.G.?

405
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,850
"T"不正是临时的意思吗
The "T" stands for "Temporary," Right?

406
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,150
你想上床吗
You wanna go to bed?

407
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,370
不不  这更凉快
No, no. ‭It's -- It's cooler down here.

408
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,950
你还需要什么
What can I get you?

409
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,630
我给你泡点茶  好茶叶
I'll make you some tea -- uh, the good stuff,

410
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,580
不是医院里那种发黄的水
not that brown water they have at the hospital.

411
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,540
不用了
I'm fine.

412
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,740
我去给你泡茶
I'll make you some tea.

413
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,920
吉米  别去
Jimmy. No.

414
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,620
你就...
Just --

415
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,990
你没事了
You've done your duty.

416
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,190
你可以走了
You can go now.

417
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,090
我有点咄咄逼人了
That came out a bit harsh.

418
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,100
我在医院已经被百般折磨了
Look, I've been zapped and poked and prodded,

419
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,800
现在  我只想自己待会
and now I just I wanna be left alone.

420
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,490
如果你身体又出什么问题
If things start going south for you again,

421
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,850
我怎么能知道呢
how am I even gonna know?

422
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,130
我没事的  我保证
I'm fine. I promise.

423
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,640
看见没
See?

424
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,190
已经感觉好多了
Feeling better already.

425
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,700
我连钥匙都没有
I mean, ‭I don't even have a key, so...

426
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,790
我能叫欧尼回来吗
Can I get Ernie back here?

427
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,060
至少让我为你做这件事  行吗
Would you let me ‭do that for you, at least?

428
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,820
你需要有人来照看你
You need someone lookin' in on ya.

429
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,010
你得吃饭  不是吗
You gotta eat, right?

430
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,720
好吧
All right.

431
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,100
早日康复  查克
Feel better, Chuck.

432
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,840
别这么做

433
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,030
好的  我这就去办
All right, I will get right on that.

434
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,320
下周应该就能帮你办好
I should have it for you by early next week.

435
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,360
祝你今日愉快  柯林斯先生
You have yourself ‭a wonderful day, Mr. Collins.

436
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,830
对了
Oh! There you go.

437
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,380
把墨镜拿出来
Yeah, get the sunglasses out.

438
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,610
外面很亮
It's very bright.

439
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,710
得保护好眼睛
Gotta protect the ol' peepers.

440
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,010
你得...
You gotta...

441
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,000
好  帅呆了
Yep, looking sharp.

442
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,970
就这样
Bingo.

443
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,760
回头见
Uh, bye-bye, now.

444
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,110
好了
Okay.

445
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,740
大家好  抱歉让你们久等
Folks, I'm sorry about the wait,

446
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,120
我为每位委托人花这么长时间
but the attention I give each client means

447
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,860
意味着有时候大家需要等等
sometimes, things get a little...backed up.

448
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,060
不过我向你们保证
Uh but I promise

449
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,620
会按顺序为你们服务
to get to each and every one of you in turn.

450
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,810
德谢佐女士  亲爱的  你是下一位
Mrs. DeShazo, my dear, I believe you're next.

451
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,990
先问一句  有谁想喝咖啡吗
But first, may I get anybody some coffee?

452
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,800
我能和你谈谈吗
Can I talk to you?

453
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,640
稍等一下
Uh, excuse me one second.

454
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,440
我们昨天就得找个前台
We have got to get a receptionist -- like, yesterday.

455
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,910
吉米  霍华德刚才来电话了
Jimmy, Howard just called.

456
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,880
他说他一早上都在联系你
He says he's been trying to reach you all morning.

457
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,740
那又怎样  叫他别烦你了  给我留言
So? Tell him to stop bothering you and leave me a message.

458
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,380
是查克的事
It's about Chuck.

459
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,010
他只说很重要
It's impmptant -- that's all he'll say.

460
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,470
好吧
Okay.

461
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,740
很遗憾  我的同事告诉我
Unfortunately, uh, my associate tells me

462
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,220
我有简短但紧急的法律事务要处理
I'm needed for some brief but pressing legal business.

463
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,850
我很快打个电话就好
I just need to make one quick phone call.

464
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,800
谁想要咖啡来着
Uh, in the meantime, who was it who wanted coffee?

465
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,300
好的  这位年轻的女士会给你们倒咖啡
Yeah, okay, uh, this young lady will get you coffee...

466
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,830
还有面包圈  如果还有的话
and, also, doughnuts if there are any left.

467
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,400
我要咖啡  不加奶
I want coffee, but I do not want cream.

468
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,950
朱莉  是我  给霍华德回电话
Hey, Julie, it's me, returning Howard's call.

469
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,200
对
Yeah.

470
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,490
怎么了
Hey, what's up?

471
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,080
吉米  我就问一个问题
Jimmy, ‭I have just one question --

472
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,880
这是你策划的吗
are you behind this?

473
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,720
策划什么
Am I behind what?

474
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,950
吉米  我现在正忙着呢
Jimmy, I'm kind of in the middle of somethin' right now.

475
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,410
-过会再来吧  -不  不  不
- Come back later. - No, no, no.

476
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,800
拜托  把门打开
Come on. Open the door.

477
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:27,440
我知道你为什么来  我们可以一会再说
I know why you're here. We can discuss it later.

478
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,510
我正忙着呢  再见
Right now I'm busy, goodbye.

479
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,290
满意了吧
You happy now?

480
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,010
这样不行  我连这里的钥匙都没有
It's not right -- me not havin' a key to this place.

481
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,170
查克
Chuck?

482
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,170
查克  这怎么回事
So, Chuck...uh, what's up?

483
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,700
你弄了个...
You got a little, uh --

484
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,340
你弄了个工程啊
You got a little, uh, uh, project goin' on?

485
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,950
你想跟我说说这是怎么回事吗
Uh, something you maybe wanna tell me about?

486
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,520
查克  跟我说说行吗
Whaddya say, Chuck? Y-- Uh, clue me in?

487
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,460
这些墙是石膏和板条的
These walls are plaster and lath --

488
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:22,200
对无线电波完全没防护作用
completely invisible to the radio spectrum.

489
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,460
一点也没有
No protection at all --

490
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,530
我还不如直接站到一片牧草地里呢
I might as well be standing in the middle of a pasture.

491
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,680
真不知道当初怎么想的
I don't know what I was thinking.

492
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,250
一开始就该这么做
Shoulda done this from the start.

493
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,160
你是说这么做  用...
What, you shoulda done this, with the, uh --

494
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,860
我觉得这些墙还挺结实的
See, I think these walls are pretty solid. I think --

495
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,030
一种金属材质外壳  能阻止电磁波进入

496
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,030
我需要的是一个法拉第笼
See, what I really need is a proper Faraday cage.

497
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,410
那才是我需要的
That's what I need.

498
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,360
我们该坐下来  休息一会  伙计
I think we need to sit down, take a break, buddy.

499
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,290
求你了
Please?

500
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,580
别跟我来这一套  吉米
Do not patronize me, Jimmy.

501
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,530
我没疯  好吗
I'm not crazy, all right?

502
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,810
我从没说你疯了
‭I-I never said you were crazy.

503
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,480
你可能只是累坏了
That -- You're probably exhausted,

504
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,190
情有可原
a-and justifiably.

505
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,500
听着
Hey, come on. Hey.

506
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,590
就五分钟  然后你接着忙你的
Five minutes, and then right back at it.

507
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,910
我没事
I'm fine.

508
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,020
来吧  查克
Come on, Chuck.

509
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,940
休息一会
Just a break.

510
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,570
-小心点  -我知道
- Careful. - ‭I know.

511
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,420
霍华德说你辞职了
Howard tells me you quit HHM.

512
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,770
我没有辞职
I didn't quit.

513
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,040
我退休了
I retired.

514
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,250
听起来可不像退休
That's not what it sounded like.

515
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,870
不管怎样  这太突然了  你不觉得吗
Regardless, it's kinda outta the blue, don't you think?

516
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,550
他很担心你
He's worried about you.

517
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,560
他该松了一口气才对
He should be relieved.

518
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,560
松了一口气  怎么会
Relieved? Why would he be relieved?

519
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,730
你可是他的顶梁柱
You're his Number One Guy.

520
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,290
没了你  律所肯定每况愈下
Without you, that whole place goes down the drain.

521
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,390
你退休了
So, you -- you retired --

522
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,380
不仅从哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所退休
not just from HHM,

523
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,270
也退出律师界了吗
but the law?

524
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,270
这可不好  查克
That's not good, Chuck.

525
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,310
律师界  需要你
The -- The law... needs you.

526
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,780
别说了
Just stop it.

527
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,530
你也需要它
And you need it.

528
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,830
到底是为什么  查克
What brought this on exactly, Chuck?

529
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,570
你不做律师还能做什么
'Cause I don't know what you are if you're not a lawyer.

530
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:30,230
你还没让我被取消律师资格
How are you gonna retire before you get me disbarred,

531
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,410
还没把我赶出城  怎么能退休
before you run me outta town on a rail, huh?

532
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:34,360
以后可就我一个麦吉尔在律师界混了
I'll be the only McGill carrying the family name.

533
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,710
你怎么忍得了
You can't have that.

534
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,260
是因为  你没能挽回梅萨维德银行吗
Is this... ‭'cause you lost Mesa Verde?

535
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,940
那又怎样  谁会在意
So what? Who cares?

536
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,810
而且  如果你真的觉得
And, hey, if you truly do think

537
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,210
这事是我在背后捅你刀子
that I rat-fucked you on that thing --

538
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,670
当然我并没有  不过随便了
which I did not, but whatever --

539
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,960
你知道吗
well, you know what?

540
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
你应该生气  应该报复
You get mad! Take action!

541
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,930
别躲在你这法拉第什么
Don't just hide out in your -- your Faraday whatever --

542
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,490
破笼子里
your cage thing here.

543
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,250
不  你该永不退休才对
No! You -- No retirement for you!

544
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,570
等你九十九岁了
When you're 99,

545
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:07,840
还要对着机器人法官做结辩陈词  然后倒地身亡
you can drop dead giving closing arguments to JudgeBot 3000 --

546
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,870
对了  那东西也是用电的
which will run on electricity, by the way.

547
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,760
这才是你的未来好吗
That's your future, okay?

548
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,270
-所以  -我
- So... ‭ - I...

549
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,760
我做不了这个工作了
‭I can't do the job anymore.

550
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,620
什么意思  你怎么就干不了了
What do you mean? ‭'Course you can do the job.

551
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,730
我犯了一个错误
I made a mistake.

552
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,900
什么错误
What mistake?

553
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,790
一个很小的错误  把银行地址搞错了
A simple, ‭nothing little bank address --

554
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,660
1261号写成了1216号
1216 instead of 1261.

555
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,950
我搞砸了
I screwed it up!

556
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,510
我让委托人蒙受损失
I hurt the client.

557
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,980
彻彻底底搞砸了
Blew it completely and utterly.

558
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,280
而且我还把这怪到你头上
And then I blamed -- And then I blamed you.

559
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,410
都怪这该死的电流
It's this goddamned electricity!

560
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,850
一点一点消磨我  把我的机能消磨殆尽
It's wearing me down! It's wearing down my faculties!

561
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:54,310
我的头脑  我的思维  曾经
My brain...my mind -- it used to be --

562
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,400
它曾经那么敏捷
You know, it used to work!

563
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,040
可现在完全不管用了
And now it doesn't anymore.

564
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,260
有人因为我而受伤害
People got hurt because of me.

565
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,690
是时候结束了
Time to end it.

566
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,190
如果我告诉你你并没有犯错呢
What if I told you ‭you didn't make a mistake?

567
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,420
天哪  吉米  别来安慰我了
For Christ's sakes, Jimmy, stop humoring me.

568
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,930
别说得好像一切都不是我的错
Stop trying to talk everything right.

569
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,380
我背叛了你
I rat-fucked you.

570
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,010
是我干的
It was me.

571
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,610
尼克松都得为我自豪
I would made Nixon proud.

572
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,270
我把1261改成了1216
I changed 1261 to 1216.

573
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,010
是我干的
It was me.

574
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,450
事情的经过就像你说的一样
It all went down exactly like you said --

575
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,150
分毫不差
I mean, exactly.

576
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,060
我篡改了文件
I doctored the copies.

577
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,700
买通打印店的小伙子让他为我撒谎
I paid the kid at the shop to lie for me.

578
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:05,850
每一个细节都如你所料  你太神了
It is insane how you got every detail exactly right.

579
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,320
这下你能放心了吧
So you can relax, okay?

580
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:15,050
你的脑子好用着呢  马力十足
'Cause that brain of yours is chugging along at 1,000% efficiency.

581
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,050
你说的是真的吗
Are you telling the truth,

582
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:23,060
还是你只是为了让我好受点
or are you just trying to make me feel better?

583
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,870
当然是为了让你好受点
I am sayin' it to make ya feel better.

584
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:27,300
不然我怎么可能说出来
I sure as shit wouldn't be telling ya otherwise.

585
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,480
但没错  这就是真相
But, yes... it's the truth.

586
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,660
你这么大费周章就为了羞辱我吗
You'd go to such lengths to humiliate me?

587
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,310
我是为了金
I did it for Kim!

588
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,920
她废寝忘食拿下梅萨维德银行
What -- She worked her butt off to get Mesa Verde

589
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,040
而你和霍华德就喝喝威士忌坐享其成
while you and Howard sat around sipping Scotch and chortling.

590
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,820
什么哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill --

591
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,220
应该叫斯克鲁奇马利律所才对
more like Scrooge and Marley!

592
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,220
狄更斯小说中的守财奴

593
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,050
梅萨维德银行是金的
Kim deserves Mesa Verde --

594
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:53,580
不是你  也不是哈姆林麦吉尔联合律所的not you, not HHM.

595
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,180
她争取来的  她需要它
She earned it, and she needs it!

596
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,810
我这么做是为了帮她
I did it to help her,

597
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,420
但我真不知道这会给你带来那么大的伤害
but I-I honestly didn't think it would hurt you so bad.

598
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,200
我以为你只会说  "靠  我犯了个错误"
I thought you'd just say, "Oh, crap, I made a mistake,"

599
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,630
然后继续过你的日子  这才是正常人会干的
and go on with your life, like a normal person!

600
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:07,920
可你偏不
But, oh, no!

601
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,360
是我太天真
Wishful thinking!

602
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,040
所以  我能不能告诉霍华德
So, can I, uh, tell Howard

603
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,020
你不辞职也不退休了
you're not quitting or retiring or whatever?

604
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,100
还有  能不能把这些破玩意从墙上弄下来
And can we take all this shit down off the walls?

605
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,430
我这就打电话给霍华德
I'm gonna go call Howard.

606
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,390
吉米
Jimmy.

607
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,320
你刚刚承认犯了一项重罪你知道吧
You do realize ‭you just confessed to a felony?

608
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,500
算是吧
I guess.

609
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,020
可你觉得好多了  是吧
But you feel better, right?

610
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,920
再说了  就我们俩  空口无凭
Besides, ‭it's your word against mine.
